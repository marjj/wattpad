<p data-p-id="b0b87a4311b55d51a1623a7737e92cd4">When Lan opened her eyes to the piercing sunlight. As she looked around blankly, she realized that she had slept in the cabin.

</p><p data-p-id="88936499c445db1d71c6bf48c8e5bc2f">"Are you awake?"

</p><p data-p-id="66143ad7db188f3281166fdd23e18142">"Oh, yes. Oh-did it stop snowing?"

</p><p data-p-id="b7b873afee92a073a49378ef08098e90">"Yes, thank God."

</p><p data-p-id="73532d7ea6f88fe5219e753665f43352">To Eustaf, Lan rose from her seat and immediately reeled.

</p><p data-p-id="5f49a65707912e3bf76547ed63d58b69">"Lan?!"

</p><p data-p-id="0ea9cd112c50a11f9bbeda03cdd76bbf">Surprised Eustaf caught her, and Lan was turning around and closing her eyes for a long time.

</p><p data-p-id="3881f38ee88b46effc74a105a4ecccec">"I must be hungry and dizzy."

</p><p data-p-id="249be3d1a6c82ab4e6cdeb5ff22765b2">"You're too skinny. You haven't been able to eat a whole lot lately."

</p><p data-p-id="05d04d4e2bb67e1ef76990e1897a09f1">Eustaf frowned and Lan laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="70dc81de888d2765480b54576d338cff">"Now I can eat well."

</p><p data-p-id="f419f00eeefe6c9919edbcf368acf855">"I have to go down right now."

</p><p data-p-id="200c4e2bf5b0baf9b68d52212ad51685">Then he began to dress her. She insisted that she could dress herself because she felt like a seven-year-old child, but he didn't pretend to hear and dressed Lan tightly and hugged her.

</p><p data-p-id="b15efe189a42e4d4c2ab8015ef5eedc9">Lan said again, "I can walk," but he went outside again this time without pretending to hear it.

</p><p data-p-id="c568e605a6b8fdd49b0d4053c8a80582">He put Lan on the sled and sat behind it. Lan was relieved only then.

</p><p data-p-id="686e8394c73ce4225bd03e1795b728bd">If Eustaf had been carrying me the whole time, I wouldn't have been able to stand it.

</p><p data-p-id="2934e707b853cf28d7323bf19acd4ec1">Lan held on to a string full of large sleigh drops made of copper and glistening in the morning sun.

</p><p data-p-id="5ceb689233e96aaf959c5a0d600330c2">"Let's go."

</p><p data-p-id="4ab998b30ccb1c13c6a053be209959e4">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="e0ddc4f2bd0d8beeffdb986fc347e121">Lan nodded, and Eustaf pushed the sled forward. The front nose tilted slightly and slid over the snow, speeding up the sled in an instant.

</p><p data-p-id="5f6f7aa5f30f141897536f7aad20d796">Lan burst into a scream of laughter. Every time I passed the bend, the sound of the bell rang brightly.

</p><p data-p-id="61868aa449441a44423d1c9309c8c70b">When I went down like that, the servants were already coming up. It was Lumie who took the lead in running.

</p><p data-p-id="e5ef13ad96d67020dcc3b9d16b8990a1">"Duke! Master!"

</p><p data-p-id="473e0e99060b8bd92b138d686b0c7716">Eustaf tripped and stopped the sled. Lan was going to wake up slowly thinking about the dizziness earlier, but Eustaf got up first and hugged her.

</p><p data-p-id="5ce661d3a302627f00847e6c8c02c5be">"Are you all right? Are you injured?"

</p><p data-p-id="a4148ec3c99e3d45cc44dc084d4d0b59">Lan shook her head at Lumiere's question.

</p><p data-p-id="a2212b601af5208b2fb82a9d3531d868">"We're both fine. I was in the cabin."

</p><p data-p-id="c23006aa28ec37527c53d408b7d00fe1">Relief brushed against Lumiere's face.

</p><p data-p-id="b48a7708313ffc20d8730bec35bf0fd3">"I'm glad."

</p><p data-p-id="a5a63ff64f21549cb4b6e0fc5c45b302">"Call a therapist," Eustaf said, and Lumiere opened his eyes wide and frowned at Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="3a6a5d97b924f58baa0d5c4bbb3ce4a2">"You're sick again. Why aren't you talking?"

</p><p data-p-id="d6589dbfa63c6254ba937116a1482396">"It doesn't hurt! I was just dizzy because I couldn't eat breakfast."

</p><p data-p-id="bf9992d41d892e7d413af706afa51252">"Losing balance and falling down?"

</p><p data-p-id="068d406393352d35cefac97384580d69">"It's really okay."

</p><p data-p-id="f207225284212c9e93cc95235173dcc6">Ignoring Lan's words, Lumiere said.

</p><p data-p-id="dffdf281c9fb296492cf69e99cc98dea">"I'll go ahead and call him."

</p><p data-p-id="41c72b03ac5510c10a695f742aadad7c">Then, quickly left, Lan breathed a sigh.

</p><p data-p-id="2de3105c79a929c475ad92b7f8c15a29">When I arrived at the mansion, a therapist was waiting for me, so I went to see a doctor, but it was also a mild anemia.

</p><p data-p-id="471ccab6e953b071d16bf9b14e0c1fba">Lan soon received a hearty breakfast - including a liver dish - and emptied the table to show everyone she wasn't feeling sick.

</p><p data-p-id="eb83d54cab2f75cf777bf6fd0caef1de">Then Kiri smiled and came in with dessert and said.

</p>

<p data-p-id="64ed8aed7fd604f5ecb8bc1e0abcdb12">"I heard you're getting engaged."

</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="f7aee280f12f1dce2735d5690ff7855b">Lan was drink some tea when she saw Kiri in surprise. Dimodia, Soda, and Kara look at Kiri with their faces, "Oh, my?" and look at Kiri.

</p><p data-p-id="d1b0c0846c17d2d73f09b29ba4388f68">"The Lord said earlier. He's getting engaged before this week."

</p><p data-p-id="0a41565dd5ca256adc26b1f3ba97525f">"Fast!"

</p><p data-p-id="abbbf6fb7ab02a26a7e76874bae0b310">Lan shouted and then laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="207065c59d07c448300e74ac5d5343e0">"Yes, I will."

</p><p data-p-id="2458d50bf779f273a4e84beda6a37301">Kiri smiled brightly and put down the jelly and said.

</p><p data-p-id="180b88080b90f4c37f226a08ac47b087">"Congratulations."

</p><p data-p-id="24a7371e7b277795025eafb7e42808f5">Dimodia also said, bending her knees lightly.

</p><p data-p-id="55f01fbefdb081026bc943bcb555133e">"I admire you."

</p><p data-p-id="60ee327224b40e74d6fff76e14b270d3">"Congratulations."

</p><p data-p-id="b34546ff27d96ef882014fbf5d263d77">"Congratulations."

</p><p data-p-id="d583d41faa36013249b497eca6f23b37">Kara and Soda also quickly greeted each other. Lan said, feeling somewhat embarrassed.

</p><p data-p-id="e358edfacc0ed740a32fa89e23b9e79c">"Thank you, everyone."

</p><p data-p-id="9ed696c8886e920691243d6a3b33eb7e">Kara snorted and said. <br>"But it's before this week. Oh, my God, we only have three days left, right?"

</p><p data-p-id="0ee13af1540a16415d5320ac778d2e08">Soda also opened her eyes round. <br>"Oh, my God, when are we going to get everything ready?"

</p><p data-p-id="fb70de78dc160499f5d373a8b927d84a">"What about the dress? The dress for the engagement?" Kara's face turned pale. said Lan, waving her hand.

</p><p data-p-id="e37504afc435363c52e495308ae2f87d">"It's an engagement anyway. It's between us, so we're going to do it simply. I can't even call a guest to Lazia in the winter."

</p><p data-p-id="b80b2f2cbb314d4c600a619f5a74b4a1">"But you have to do the basics."

</p><p data-p-id="3a353529f237656429f194e549702ab2">Kiri shook her head. Lan opened a spoonful of red pudding and frowned. It feels strange, but it smells strangely fishy.

</p><p data-p-id="ec466c223b5a72ff7845469edad24c4a">"What kind of jelly is this?"

</p><p data-p-id="057416a1c2edd4393d695e77f5dae85e">"Seonji jelly."

</p><p data-p-id="4c96af02d603ce87650c37add626761b">"..."

</p><p data-p-id="edc42d0199671ae0485d89e0085822f2">Lan put down the spoon. I've been patient with my liver, but this is too much.

</p><p data-p-id="2db9553a13c9b75e450541f76e46ffb1">"It's an anemia, so it's specially made? Hurry up and eat."

</p><p data-p-id="ca91beec9d92c168be47790e44cadf9f">"I can't, I won't! If I eat breakfast, I'll throw up everything I ate."

</p><p data-p-id="2818023641adf967223e9ce325bc8889">"You can't help it."

</p><p data-p-id="2dbac84893871d8d7fd71b0b31e66c56">"I can't eat."

</p><p data-p-id="8db77f538c1e9431460062ecdc94679e">"I caught a calf on purpose."

</p><p data-p-id="4919629487b58f9bfee187f158c6d361">"Poor thing!"

</p><p data-p-id="8fe2b0537a2e45d00e16dc72591a4010">"There will be veal meat for lunch."

</p><p data-p-id="e8142dec1708983acebf90e27119c565">"That, that sounds delicious," said Lan, Dimodia.

</p><p data-p-id="07b32c0b84593a2ed6bd3dc29b2b05f6">"You can't eat this anyway."

</p><p data-p-id="c73e387af0502165000458c13b32b85c">When Lan pushed the plate firmly away, Kiri picked up the jelly plate with a sad face. Lan shuddered.

</p><p data-p-id="ec595e6e78bf96cd518ebca4f531f569">'Seonji Jelly?' I hate it.

</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******

</p><p data-p-id="5200ba8336ec0b11dbc505113c04d90e">Sina was sweating from her back. Somehow she was called by the Duke of Lazia. He usually pretends to be himself.

</p><p data-p-id="5ae1617961b1df6877b9410aae7ed6ec">She was very nervous. <br>Lan is kind to himself, but the lord was Eustaf anyway, and if he doesn't like it, she'll be kicked out.

</p><p data-p-id="23dbf7a65c0ddf54667928041602311c">But what he says when she sits down.

</p><p data-p-id="7228f26a091b6d1704bed92dfcb1c960">'Why do you ask me?'

</p><p data-p-id="2e107563017fc28c4955db059d5d7b0c">Eustaf sat cross-legged in front of her and asked once again.

</p><p data-p-id="7708a6456767a502e2db64a4da75065f">"Is there nothing in the world that you do at the engagement?"

</p><p data-p-id="c3e7ca9062ec9b02f4bc04d6cc0bb13b">"I, I don't know."

</p><p data-p-id="bf8a4eadcd55a11c42e6e4d64fadbd72">Sina fumbled hard in her head. At the engagement?

</p><p data-p-id="95fe499d152ab13a02873595838c98a9">What's she doing?

</p>
<p data-p-id="7a70c115dcc2f34810075bd333e5e65a">Sina thought hard about the contents of the drama.

</p><p data-p-id="e5ff654c2c286dac7837923d75deb35c">"Champagne Tower?"

</p><p data-p-id="4b8086adb1590a9fd026f6013ac9a060">As Sina spoke carefully, Eustaf eyes were distinctive.

</p><p data-p-id="fa9d3eac7f0f1fbf843a4a0ad71ea048">"What is that?"

</p><p data-p-id="113cf26a5cf170f0c9158d6af7bfefb5">"Uh- stack the glass like a tower, pour the liquor from the top and let it overflow. Like a waterfall."

</p><p data-p-id="9267f4095c1ddefed3eba90aa5de4b5b">"Hmm."

</p><p data-p-id="f65466d45f3b8634538b0245c791705b">Eustaf thought about it once. <br>Isn't it quite extravagant to pour expensive alcohol like that?

</p><p data-p-id="5f46e0f7803916749050c1bc6da6aa03">"But this is my whole world story...."

</p><p data-p-id="bd69dba4f27974a2cb3bee9cef78a0db">"That'll do. Anything else?"

</p><p data-p-id="38af84e563c42309b8a82a3c14d427c3">Eustaf knew that Lan was from the same world as Sina, so he wanted to do something for the world. That's why I'm asking a question, but Sina really felt like, 'What's wrong with him?'

</p><p data-p-id="e1cd9c6be4b020d00ee03d462a3e90b3">Sina said, scratching her cheek.

</p><p data-p-id="30c73a6b4dfd8b3cc18c2e8dc70aebf3">"In fact, engagements are rare in our world."

</p><p data-p-id="8cde4a2722041bf749c9e7c8d6f78532">"Rare?"

</p><p data-p-id="676050579975fd032673454b12617d53">"Yes, everyone gets married right away."

</p><p data-p-id="d85539d1d58957431bc5ebe30b3f488a">"Is that so·····?"

</p><p data-p-id="a3c9fab5c276ae6333febda6d953ef9c">Eustaf knocked on a special armrest. Sina explained with a nod.

</p><p data-p-id="2fc924918a2767af5c63047ed3e9aef2">"I think I've been in a relationship for about two years. And then I propose-"

</p><p data-p-id="992bcaf615ebd2a2d9cc73b786f2f372">"What is it?"

</p><p data-p-id="d95652ca613541170fa3568fc221c72f">"Yes?"

</p><p data-p-id="a7100389d7159ce33c28858ad5764c5d">"Propose."

</p><p data-p-id="dc090724f2a9e91883b1aff92bf2dc1d">"Oh, marriage proposal. What? Is this a concept that doesn't exist?"

</p><p data-p-id="3250a4c9d57ac3a69a52d2136400c119">In a society where most of the marriages are political marriages, proposals were not so grand.

</p><p data-p-id="84fb251cae349b0367c220cd9bb43303">Sina explained the proposal with excitement, and Eustaf listened seriously.

</p><p data-p-id="445023d16089c01d43718b78f4bdc7c4">******

</p><p data-p-id="c46db4e47877746ed82c8d48f93b4877">Lan opened her eyes wide when she saw the dress Kara brought with a pleased face.

</p><p data-p-id="6fa03c7e3ade7b2d886d386aef1e6893">The light green dress had fine crystals on it, shining like a raindrop in July.

</p><p data-p-id="f67e9b9d5899dc074991e7d7185f35f7">"The Lord was ordering it."

</p><p data-p-id="53402ad348f3c23cb3113f37c7a8d4e8">"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="9619953008035fb63a62c84d41c144ed">Kara nodded as Lan asked back in surprise.

</p><p data-p-id="1e74087de078d003a76f14b762880f69">"It was ordered last year. But you didn't get the size in earnest, so you're still in the measure stage. But you can fit in with the engagement."

</p><p data-p-id="654b695a78c5aea07146316f931055bd">"With a little bit of trouble." Soda continued to laugh.

</p><p data-p-id="0de28a7619f53ba389a328581f9fd6e5">Lan caressed a soft, cloudy mint-colored dress.

</p><p data-p-id="af9de0dc103576f38dea1821c153e6c6">'Oh, my God.'

</p><p data-p-id="205edaa63786671139d6bd4cc6db3b57">The crystal was sewn so delicately that it just seemed to be attached to the clothes. In addition, each of them was made in different shapes and sizes, so it literally shone brilliantly.

</p><p data-p-id="eafd33c15cae57b4aeb1a4ceae813884">"Try it on."

</p><p data-p-id="6bc696f71c4ab5c51668510e0f09b8b6">"That's right."

</p><p data-p-id="dda1dbd8c38f156f54eeaee9055dd707">With eyes like, "I want to see you wear it quickly!" the maids clung to her, peeled Lan's clothes and dressed her in dresses.

</p><p data-p-id="d51b9dd525630d6fc021e24aad3c10ac">Dimodia exclaimed. <br>"It looks so good on you."

</p><p data-p-id="5f130fbe2b2a2b83be59cc6d3e2fcd57">"You're so beautiful."

</p><p data-p-id="1e40d3b22bb139acfb7b784152acc88a">At this point, the owner will naturally gain strength from the side of the fitting. Kara rolled up her sleeves and held up the pins.

</p><p data-p-id="93d4cb87b01c9ec5298f4b603fe88030">"I'll fix it from now on, so stay still."

</p><p data-p-id="dec19e0691c228131baa1d6baa4debf4">"Yes."

</p><p data-p-id="5126bb4fcd9d39c0dda12ef1e257c001">Lan answered calmly with her arms raised. Kiri watched from the side and said,

</p>
<p data-p-id="37b0e97642eaccf5cf55e6381ab14d13">"Well, you know, that silk cloak before, why don't you hang it on your shoulders?"

</p><p data-p-id="045995777e1d859cacee5bf6339d2603">"That's a good idea."

</p><p data-p-id="49c0752efe88fed6f0417fa5f13612ff">"Fix it with a diamond brooch."

</p><p data-p-id="5ef16c9208a9edc5ac5b01df377d5c3c">Soda nodded seriously and Lan shook her head.

</p><p data-p-id="06e65f39ca874711f04df6700ea5b25e">"Do you have time for that? Don't push yourself too hard." Kiri grinned.

</p><p data-p-id="caceea4a7ec20c481be1d0988e686b8d">"You can strain yourself at times like this. Dimodia, what about accessories?"

</p><p data-p-id="03876446cd1e83bc6f0eaf45393a7524">"Here you go. This is also ordered by Lord."

</p><p data-p-id="9f8e2de8b037d65fa8adc31ad17c6ef6">Speaking as if singing, Dimodia quickly brought a big box.

</p><p data-p-id="b6af50ff30fd8ea9f38222f1e9ce828e">Lan was stabbed by a pin while turning her head and Kara said softly, "Stay safe."

</p><p data-p-id="1dd3fee849add224b7e2b340418eddc3">Somehow I felt like a playful boy, so Lan nodded calmly.

</p><p data-p-id="32cebdeb57480ae9eb55e83f3f1bf1be">Dimodia brought the box to her front so that Lan could see it well and opened the lid.

</p><p data-p-id="5ade21897e240b4edd00c711b8875503">Lan let out a small exclamation.

</p><p data-p-id="bcbf495d8f10661a8a5517ccba472b66">It was a set of earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and rings.

</p><p data-p-id="1a9083a49588be20850d6f956db3647a">It was full of light green topaz, which was as clear as spring water. I could tell at a glance that it matched the color of the dress.

</p><p data-p-id="ada5d0419c957f5070b586c92c6a77dd">"So pretty."

</p><p data-p-id="c47e6e3535621548e33cb7be2211c95f">At Lan's words, Dimodia laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="4e0248388b364a8ebb4eb3d6c9d98333">"It'll look good in your dress."

</p><p data-p-id="15bd67fa04e27adf71c303540cece31f">Kara fixed her clothes with the last pin and nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="9720231dbecee5b7a5884c8a83e3a984">"That's a relief. The Lord couldn't have ordered the engagement without any preparation."

</p><p data-p-id="996251bd5f2876fb8933e0348c6f84a3">It was not an engagement, but an item that could be used for marriage.

</p><p data-p-id="ffc996f447a89516cbba22a3bb60b29d">It was the same clothes and jewelry that a princess of a country would bring, but the maids only nodded with the face,

</p><p data-p-id="6a762a4c54dd856d1584c1e02678aa04">"We should do this to our Lan."

</p><p data-p-id="09362474d6af6f2f7d0745edfe81b2b1">Marking the place where she held the pin, she quickly took off the dress again, leaving detailed instructions to the bedroom maids.<br><br>Kiri rolled up her sleeves and said, <br>"Well, then the dress is done, and now it's lady's turn."

</p><p data-p-id="1c2dbbfbde81aa0dd781c8ba1ed3f4fb">Dimodia nodded, and Lan gazed, "Me?"

</p><p data-p-id="5b242f63e935aee3bef862166f391e91">After a while, Lan murmured, <br>"I'm only having an engagement, but should I do this?"

</p><p data-p-id="5c4811cd4a837de2777bc009968186d0">and the maids said, <br>"You should."

</p><p data-p-id="d34869f2f41993aaaad5530d1c4c8c41">Lan is mixture by sugar, almond powder and honey, rubbing her whole body to remove hair, and experiencing all kinds of strange cosmetics folk remedies.

</p><p data-p-id="a1e9d80fbf71a741e0684e241c182b95">"It's winter, so there's less goat milk."

</p><p data-p-id="f8ecea32458142091c82e46fb85512c0">"I can't help it, let's at least use this."<br><br>They had such conversations and bathed her with goat milk, or made her sweat in a place full of hot steam and drink a lot of tea with unknown taste.

</p><p data-p-id="68440617808776232f9dfbd87ede0329">The maids even put on dirt on Lan's hair, saying, <br>"We don't have enough time."

</p><p data-p-id="8bb429e4adf204c1e2c06aeae0fc04d9">I couldn't even ask what "Ran" was at the momentum.

</p><p data-p-id="eadd334017c88d86ecf9bc208c37a72e">The food has also changed to a beauty care food that seems to be full of collagen.

</p><p data-p-id="7747153368dfaa512c03c045d5bfdd6b">Whenever I had time, I kept eating candy that smelled terrible.

</p><p data-p-id="522f96cdd19a180efafca158f0f75407">Thanks to this, Lan's skin became smooth and glossy like boiled egg whites. The hair also became as shiny as the fox's fur and shone like a glow.

</p><p data-p-id="e305727369e57c5d277d4a9f4b1d2a0d">'And my body smells.'

</p><p data-p-id="d36c0bc28607a0b392cac11740821983">Perhaps because of the strange candy, my body began to smell sweet.

</p><p data-p-id="d49ea399bd16d2788331baa85aaf8a5b">'We're just having an engagement, do we need this?'

</p><p data-p-id="eab9493191db2300e3cfb1f81c69137b">Lan lay down on the bed thinking like that. Nowadays, it has been my daily routine to sleep early and wake up late.

</p><p data-p-id="a494741c6a3d201506fc092b7d4e0cc3">'And I'm spending all my waking hours on beauty treatment.'

</p><p data-p-id="5c30ca4a9ca018ec37fec61a3a2e898d">I slept enough there and ate something delicious, so I naturally got better.

</p><p data-p-id="8b4ffe49de1d472daf0d6bdd0b2fd52f">Sina looked and seriously said, "Unnie, how are you becoming a goddess?" making Lan smile again.

</p><p data-p-id="aed1995dfb61f8ebbfcc9804c2c6a625">Then Sina whispered to Lan. <br>"Unnie"

</p><p data-p-id="d9968dd069a6025fe9e1c912e1f4621c">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="e64518c4a6467f7dc102151051a924c9">"If the Duke does anything strange, just do it."

</p><p data-p-id="12466a9eda25d58937be02aa92b7c176">"Strange?"

</p><p data-p-id="bf1bf88111bb5cfa6db53fc208e63bbf">"Yes" <br>Sina nodded her head.

</p><p data-p-id="5c3a96e9ea2937264aba71379e69f100">Sina told her about the customs of her world, so it may seem strange to people here.

</p><p data-p-id="b04c6bb81f2c052daedc24e2c6d04f1d">I don't know why Eustaf is obsessed with the customs of the world, but we should warn Lan in advance.

</p><p data-p-id="d60424a84cfddfe3414eb435529280b4">Sina shook her head thinking like that.

</p><p data-p-id="eba6daa6d9d803a2fe8782b0c3ad0c0e">"Is the engagement tomorrow?"

</p><p data-p-id="a7bca41f5236a6979eae47bdc96cf942">"Yes. I can't believe it."

</p><p data-p-id="fc292776bc1781ca167457f55a5a556b">Sina laughed at Lan's murmur.

</p><p data-p-id="c13a2ca244fba588f3ffa8a86466a456">"But it's not as fancy as a wedding. I heard that the wedding here lasts seven days and seven nights?"

</p><p data-p-id="b5a7e69ee64b818b74d9aec2751b5e28">Lan almost asked back, <br>"Really?" without realizing it.

</p><p data-p-id="de4f3936c6bbd370a5058541f9932857">Sina shook her head. <br>"But I'm glad the engagement is over in a day."

</p><p data-p-id="e95bc980fd6a2fa75113a270c033181e">"That's true." Lan nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="36a88d038f4d485f3a2a91e4c28d29e7">No, the wedding is seven days and seven nights? What the hell are you doing?

</p><p data-p-id="e7ad1b5c79326f5d34def4c443dcc535">Let the question be put aside for now, Lan told her.

</p><p data-p-id="342799ccb66c64e1cc7f5d4f2538eb7e">"How's it going? Are you all right?"

</p><p data-p-id="f3d2d589880c72c1efb0d89a5da92f81">After a complete reunion with Eustaf, Lan reflected on her lack of time.

</p><p data-p-id="6e4fa47b02f1a39bd7726edd8ca89964">Sina grinned. <br>"You always take care of me. It's okay."

</p><p data-p-id="0c221ec4da9a40c5b50e3b27cfea37ec">"If you feel uncomfortable, feel free to tell me."

</p><p data-p-id="fff92822def68bdd9e7555d67b81f7d3">"There's no such thing." Sina shook her head.

</p><p data-p-id="d5bb2b2ab743f6d3ed1fff4fbac5a260">But suddenly, I got curious and opened my mouth and closed it quickly. This is not something to ask Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="1a2935d98dd9ed0b1cd96cfd5d38a1b8">******

</p><p data-p-id="51cc13847fd4c9ca12b7b772f1d208eb">Sina told Lan to rest and left her room.

</p><p data-p-id="ea48322251e058b0dfbb6c8e684c2a4b">Sina left the mansion and headed for the Knights' Room instead of going back to her room.

</p><p data-p-id="947c6d4bb0c7e8168cf5402a65054973">And there, I could easily find Lumiere, who was still preoccupied with training.

</p><p data-p-id="4d5e4f05d17b7e3e93b04eb0dc3882b9">After the announcement of Eustaf and Lan's engagement, Lumiere's training took longer.

</p><p data-p-id="39bbb807a18dd745de25f78ccf001b29">Sina pressed the fur hood on the cape deeper and watched him train against a nearby fence.

</p><p data-p-id="6e6eb20c1e1c3cc44e351a9391667aad">It was cold, so I could see steam rising from his shoulders and head. <br>After wielding a sword for a long time, Lumiere said bluntly.

</p><p data-p-id="cf293129d428eee698f74440f93bfe84">"What?"

</p><p data-p-id="a1e2cf83fbe194b17e486be1cbaa7757">"Watching."

</p><p data-p-id="d0e2229a1192d3efb0930e9ba8cc7364">Lumiere frowned and looked around Sina.

</p><p data-p-id="22ec2baafb7b0e5e158b4b0346d82d87">"Go away."

</p><p data-p-id="0c07ae2721390307982685f00dcc726b">"I don't want it."

</p><p data-p-id="5b8ae626c094d1e0d36915a6e44601bb">"I'm not a spectacle."

</p><p data-p-id="c7f5e839d60402987868ec49d85cda2c">"It's not exactly something to watch." After talking, Sina corrected herself.

</p><p data-p-id="8175cb311d2d3bb4e3017152efd13678">"No, I'm sure you're watching."

</p><p data-p-id="6e79c46ebb91827248834adf9779a38a">Lumiere looked at Sina. He had a lot of experience to see.

</p><p data-p-id="c4934537db377939d295d2140e0b3b88">So the words were very unpleasant, but when I made eye contact with Sina, the displeasure somehow disappeared.

</p><p data-p-id="bb9519b634d3d2b2860a6432b89b6834">It is not an eye to see things for entertainment.

</p><p data-p-id="98c276786954aafc213950fc8f781778">He sighed and clapped his hands. Meaning come, Sina jumped over the fence and ran to him lightly.

</p><p data-p-id="2ff9d7a8109f3a2c582a3fe4e4f86fd3">"A round?"

</p><p data-p-id="3716da119c63c7385de054cf24076e5b">When he said, "Okay," Sina quickly went to the weapons stand and brought her share of the wooden sword.

</p><p data-p-id="d10c2d53a5b5b5de7859e6cb63adabb2">Now that she has started learning swordsmanship, Sina liked Dalian. I was going to learn everything I could and fell into such a strange world anyway. Otherwise, I think it would be unfair.
