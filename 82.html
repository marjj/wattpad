</p><p data-p-id="66e9454c30bbb11f41bd29ad81f2d8d7">an quickly turned the pages that followed.


</p><p data-p-id="c75f15544afbb76ec9b34484831e7e04">I asked you what it was, but you just laughed and didn't tell me. My wife also said she didn't know anything special.


</p><p data-p-id="ab3d056663f3b85a36ce9c9241c6d11e">'It's useless!'


</p><p data-p-id="5bb962da2d4ae6c0dec0ffc6fe8be404">Ran squeezed her hair. This was all the mention of the Viridescent Crown.


</p><p data-p-id="aff14cc151637cd26110852b8fd857d0">Iveria has repeatedly told me that she is sorry for taking on such a promising job in a place like this. My wife said it was okay. Iveria said to me, "You liked Delphanto, too," and I couldn't answer.


</p><p data-p-id="c6da4c8c0d2241417d52a4ef83fbce58">As soon as Ran discovered the name, she remembered it clearly.


</p><p data-p-id="bd024eb1bbc862500b631f4c73027373"><b>Delphanto</b>


</p><p data-p-id="ba69e343f83b2de0fc57bd495ac7d1a8">It was the name of the Darkness, the author sealed on the ice wall.


</p><p data-p-id="eeafa055ccb600a13a6057f94d8c9200">'A nasty guy who was a lover to the great sage, Iveria, but who was also sealed.'


</p><p data-p-id="4cb83adf1fecbf6ae384113488a68338">Ran thought so and sighed. She now took a sip of the cold tea and began to concentrate on the book again.


</p><p data-p-id="7184d22b7bf057d302d0665f7f241a4c">The content itself was quite exciting, but no more <br>Delphanto stories came out. About seals and ice walls. <br>Ran covered the book and put it in the bookshelf.


</p><p data-p-id="0d2c11e98843d53fd57b93287f28b3cc">'Let's take a look at the crown.'


</p><p data-p-id="b1148a3f752287e6329bd57cf5835754">I have seen it once or twice when I was young. It was because the Duchess of Lazia had been wearing it once or twice.


</p><p data-p-id="a876deee6226d3a91f795f3c776a4175">'I've never touched it myself.'


</p><p data-p-id="6593c4a0997e885167108ac724e4201d">The tiara, which is infinitely transparent, with a uniform color without any air bubbles, shines with a large emerald and a small diamond, was very beautiful even in my memory.


</p><p data-p-id="9f21c9b73a081462f605d1e9c49a1db7">'I'll have to ask Eustaf to show me when he comes later.'


</p><p data-p-id="c14af55cf5d53ca72e10d02bb8ee1725">After showing the contents of this book first.


</p><p data-p-id="89f8bdd9febf47721abfe86e71bb21b8">'You might misunderstand.'


</p><p data-p-id="fe5ac60f38aead192c744cc468733f90">Ran stretched herself out. She got up from her seat, stretched around, and breathed out a long breath.


</p><p data-p-id="2995f00fffa44778abfe4b64d6f22b47">'I should stop here for today. and send letters to the wizards to ask questions. ·······.'


</p><p data-p-id="f1f4eb8f7cd5c21ed81e209f3cf333a5">Ran left the library.


</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******


</p><p data-p-id="1ae71f9fbfe47ff6322ea56739e53412">Eustaf exhaled a long breath.


</p><p data-p-id="8cd65fe535dc3bfcdcca3d7c39489f68">I didn't think the chase would be this long.


</p><p data-p-id="30cfa73f01388272d74d91cf5b99bb1c">'I'm worried about Ran.'


</p><p data-p-id="626e09e3544cd1ab4ea1829637bacdda">He looked at the snow with such thoughts.


</p><p data-p-id="601747a1028491d0438f978e763347a3">The snow piled up in the trees and stood like a strange sculpture, and the snow was not hard and fell in.


</p><p data-p-id="016d06f1255f57aab6151d9c09075c4a">"Koake (the ostrich-looking masu, the head looks like a chicken and spews poison) is too smart for a crowd."


</p><p data-p-id="6f38f55ce6388e56f7885adc3952b228">Ross nodded at Eustaf's words.


</p><p data-p-id="3da2a6e59b65b912eac24e9b536660eb">"A bunch of people are divided, and some of them are sent separately to dazzle them."


</p><p data-p-id="d396bac5f227c2c7eb3cfb16dd1f8e97">Ross looked at the forest in front of him.


</p><p data-p-id="70f2358259db90b204d6aa68579da3fe">"I feel like I'm running into a trap."


</p><p data-p-id="e40d2903bbf6edfefce442fbce6894dc">When Eustaf turned around, Lumiere smiled. Eustaf did not like the relaxed smile, but he was a good leader and knew the difference between public and private.


</p><p data-p-id="ca529855c2b9db484a7563a28ef0657b">"Trap?"


</p><p data-p-id="b8656cf76cc12afbe502173ff7151385">"Yes, don't you think they're being lured in a certain direction? I don't know much about Masu."


</p>

<p data-p-id="6a344b25f83bc29594f3d575c7394e5b">I've only killed humans.

</p><p data-p-id="d41c8e89b8dfc3f518caff9eeab789f2">At Lumiere's words, Eustaf squinted, "It's an inducement."

</p><p data-p-id="ea2b822c028a15d254b2b32f1a84eb59">I didn't even think about it because I thought it was just a big deal, but it felt plausible to hear Lumiere's words.

</p><p data-p-id="8183c11430807c069976f2be8de3657e">"Masu can't have that kind of hair, especially for a chicken dog."

</p><p data-p-id="0fd822a95d66d0db798b3cd8a9b61ae5">Ross spit out his amazement, and Lumiere crushed his shoulder.

</p><p data-p-id="ee068a42eb9ace918db205013101e649">"Who have we been chasing that chicken head for a week?" Lumiere laughed, spitting out a white breath.

</p><p data-p-id="968f7e49f0e2aa85b159260780fc1545">"Is it a fish stand?"

</p><p data-p-id="a278428ac4097dcd634936ebb9564e9a">"You!"

</p><p data-p-id="3d57a4cb2b4d38aa643f12c0ab6b28a4">Ross was furious at the moment, but the other members of the knights burst out laughing.

</p><p data-p-id="31a7e7990a71b7452c1065b7deb74d17">"Certainly, it hurts my pride to be swayed so much by the Koake."

</p><p data-p-id="cb7fa5fa1b1a1784f68b1d8c78594b07">"Is there something at the top of the list if it's an inducement?"

</p><p data-p-id="9ce5b96bc2b6d54ec0d08c100ce28340">"Well, what kind of spell can Koake have?" Eustaf said.

</p><p data-p-id="aa2d0ac2a18aa332ff52cab497444c56">"Cocartless."

</p><p data-p-id="d0eb8be8b1f93aa39d87829defbab0e5">At the moment, silence circulated and Ross spit it out.

</p><p data-p-id="9c1a24cc3151fe5af88ed240887dd6e6">"Isn't that a legendary beast?"

</p><p data-p-id="ebb2ddedc9cae94000da17d37a179759">The giant monster, which combines the appearance of a male and a snake, makes the eye contact person stone and emits poison from his mouth.

</p><p data-p-id="3e1e2e9d4f46533924bdb9a4e966db4d">Eustaf said with a light shoulder. <br>"But maybe he's coming…"

</p><p data-p-id="9896fde974ab1292dad4014986ea8a27">Then he put down the helm and said, <br>"Formation 3."

</p><p data-p-id="4e6468c435a6cc6be4366cd844aefe5e">Then everyone pulled out a sword and quickly formed a formation around Eustaf.

</p><p data-p-id="84a1099cda790f041f72d3cc825f59fe">-kkeuk,kkeuk,kkeuk

</p><p data-p-id="c0ed53b2e3e9fe34318343b1e97e96dc">Koake's cries began to be heard here and there. <br>Lumiere took a deep breath.

</p><p data-p-id="7c569c3487770e2fa8b67ec8ead55a87">'My feet are uncomfortable.'

</p><p data-p-id="7620ad97528b8b1a11ef2ba435f1ce59">You can't fight with your eyes on, and your boots have spikes to prevent slipping, but that doesn't mean you're not uncomfortable when you move.

</p><p data-p-id="b5c27a703fe7f63fe907e2f430691ef1">"Kkiekk!"

</p><p data-p-id="86c06d08e61f26cb69563a36a012c8a1">The trees fell down with a loud sound that made me want to cover my ears. And at the same time, dozens of koakes ran out. <br>It looked like they were ambushing them. There was a sound of hard beaks and shields hitting everywhere. <br>The neck was only thick as young trees, but it was hard, so it took a lot of discipline to cut it off at once. However, there were no articles in the Knights of Blue flame that failed to cut Koake's neck in one piece. As I steadily reduced the number of koakes, I heard a loud noise again.

</p><p data-p-id="b1b85fda6e979b7f71bf774515453ca1">"Kkiekkkkk!"

</p><p data-p-id="b71a3621f462113a2f089c1aa3b6e0c2">In the snow field of winter, which looks 3m high to the head, a Koake with too much noticeably colorful color flew in half, flapping its wings.

</p><p data-p-id="dee626ee09530aec8e9f1c70426a6af7">"Don't look directly into his eyes!" Eustaf shouted.

</p><p data-p-id="5e13e2f4b099d66fb89942df6c3b8596">"Team A is coming with me, Form 2."

</p><p data-p-id="de567d42ffe3bdd935f9f316fccd8f26">When Eustaf began to run out, some knights ran after him. They plugged in the black road and pulled out the daggers hanging from their backs. <br>Lumiere was one of them.

</p><p data-p-id="51aa57224cd87acd73ae5425a5f9226d">Bum!

</p><p data-p-id="f321fc3f60be2c06d2429e3b92129199">With a fairly heavy sound, the Koake settled on the snow. It was then began to spit out poison. <br>The knights held up shields. <br>Eustaf whispered softly.

</p><p data-p-id="bdfbca2e4eabb4c86bbe64f5a9ddf426">"Blue flame."

</p><p data-p-id="a44463c611578ac90a711fea3ea7370f">At the same time, koake's head caught fire. Hearing a terrible scream, Eustaf frowned.

</p><p data-p-id="3315d3481d68df630b0edd80c298ded0">'Oh God, you're getting away with it!?'

</p><p data-p-id="da8622ca8a53f01550af529d1e9e8c6d">Even in making it impossible to use only his eyes, his strength was sucked out as if he had already run for a long time in the army. <br>Koake must have a defense against mana. <br>In its place, the knights threw a javelin aiming at the Koake. It was a good target because it was big and big. One or two, the javelin struck the wing. However, the rest were stuck properly, and only then the knights pulled out their swords and ran toward the Koake.

</p>

<p data-p-id="b036bf564d1ebfb800696a7390a1fdcd">The Koake last took poison, but it didn't last long. The battle ended with Eustaf cutting his throat.


</p><p data-p-id="97e4a2817fda5ccc8d6622f3fed634cd">Ross said, kicking the Koake.


</p><p data-p-id="7889a0e0b76136e9798e40193b7f7369">"You said it was a legend, but it looks nothing like that."


</p><p data-p-id="f9462485a63f9422cb1dd1535f72531b">"Blood is used as a cure."


</p><p data-p-id="55cacbbbb9bd2ecf2c5c31d246aad911">Lumiere looked at the body of Koake for a moment and saw Eustaf.


</p><p data-p-id="efab32408f46ea05d49ac71f92a6de52">'Who's going to win the fight?'


</p><p data-p-id="506d2b982432009ce86bc6c3cfa14f6a">An enemy who uses fire from afar to burn his opponent. The battle would have been extremely difficult if the Koake hadn't been blinded from the beginning.


</p><p data-p-id="e457f1d914b1103f19764d9ff0ebdd57">"Shouldn't we at least pull out a feather and display it?"


</p><p data-p-id="0809e8b3bbea1451e9c1f57bbf0b1304">The knights were so excited that they talked to each other, but Blue ring cried. Eustaf frowned, and at that moment, Koake swung a log-like tail.


</p><p data-p-id="df8a7721bd84c49cfb400e1b7becd4f0">"!!!"


</p><p data-p-id="6a7bdcf523652d190fa2600f348fc5f3">It was a defenseless blow.


</p><p data-p-id="f7e140eb64725d1b464bb9947c3075b1">"Lord!" <br>Ross shouted.


</p><p data-p-id="85ed7bd8cdb90bd600ccd561483314ac">Even though he was in armor, he flew off considerably.


</p><p data-p-id="bde5534c44a5791611febfdf2e8c827b">Eustaf swallowed a groan in pain and raised himself up. The headless Koake body stood up from its seat. <br>Everyone stood back, swearing.


</p><p data-p-id="68c07027e02f0992d66d41ea20bbeb46">"Whe-where…."


</p><p data-p-id="ee854f1a91e1b1dd65cb877d85cd3f22">The decapitated throat was said to be the cry of the Koake, but everyone knew it was a human word.


</p><p data-p-id="eee94bebebc19438f5742ab294bf9af8">"Whe-where… Lazia…."


</p><p data-p-id="4c5d09342b2702ba866cd2f69a8f6d04">Then the body of Koake disappeared in plain black smoke. Ross unknowingly uttered harsh words and ran to Eustaf.


</p><p data-p-id="85b608bdc44233d6526f0d69c41a09e4">"Lord, are you alright?"


</p><p data-p-id="1cb0a5262b6ae9a1d61bf7dc957a0f2a">"I’m alright." <br>


</p><p data-p-id="6f2f3bdf5a8a92ee39ca8e38715ad342">That's what Eustaf said and added. <br>"Go back quickly."


</p><p data-p-id="e5933c280c9f264daeda39039c3554c8">To Lazia. To the Sky castle. <br>It was one mind for all the knights. Everyone could not understand what the monster said, so they headed to the Sky castle at a rapid pace.


</p><p data-p-id="445023d16089c01d43718b78f4bdc7c4">******


</p><p data-p-id="bd03a95900ac6d3b56778b8e2d8b3d09">Ran went to the front door in her daily clothes to greet Eustaf, who returned without contacting her.


</p><p data-p-id="1854f5aa805639f6998d6c82ba5f2104">"Eus!"


</p><p data-p-id="f29b0ca41b3ba60886d8fde0e9e10bf2">When he saw Ran running with a smile, Eustaf realized how nervous and anxious he had been so far. She hugs him tightly and laughed as if she were throwing herself.


</p><p data-p-id="7cb6fef8359b5274b1220a81b6c86737">"It's hard. It's cold."


</p><p data-p-id="437b56cbad0d62f5fc962446b3cfe83a">Eustaf also smiled without realizing it and pushed her away gently.


</p><p data-p-id="25f1adee57236e5b9bdaeb179fbdf50a">"Your clothes are getting dirty."


</p><p data-p-id="017956cc7f9d06262d8f187fd7179106">"You're not hurt anywhere, are you? Are you okay? What about the others? Is everything all right?"


</p><p data-p-id="2aff6dfee495676ba79e343ee30f5897">"Yes, everything is fine." <br>That's what Eustaf said and whispered.


</p><p data-p-id="06d96202eb967bb80366d79852f6cb57">"Can I wash up and give you a hug again later?"


</p><p data-p-id="57f190e7aabc13d7561d0bde094d99c3">Ran blushed and whispered the same thing.


</p><p data-p-id="3b1aa618930da97987df076640fdaa46">"You don't have to ask." Eustaf laughed.


</p><p data-p-id="1a2935d98dd9ed0b1cd96cfd5d38a1b8">******


</p><p data-p-id="06401375b6f66872175402be95b6a4de">While Eustaf was going to wash up, Ran found Lumiere and asked after her. Lumiere smiled after sweeping up the scarlet hair that caught people's eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="96183b50afe32aca054e7313352416f8">"It's fine."


</p><p data-p-id="314958f21f857fc046c31fdcb740b10f">"Good thing. I was worried. I can't hear any news from Lumiere."


</p><p data-p-id="d0a3f74eaf52e11aa9b7a0bc4ff7aea9">"And I thought I should try harder."


</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"


</p><p data-p-id="9117f4777ee58175dc57fc52a56067a4">If you try to get that much of a hit, you won't be able to do it with a lot of ability.


</p><p data-p-id="4c5c26e5e933fef6608f90770841a267">Lumiere thought so and whispered. <br>"But did the Lord say he was okay?"


</p>
<p data-p-id="aff42bd075b75ea13d74d6d8e4ced834">"Huh? Uh, why? what's going on?"      on-inline-comments-modal">

</p><p data-p-id="51f2080342e2ffd8e6f28980ee950524">Ran's voice also dropped. Lumiere smirked and said, <br>"I think his ribs are cracked. It must have gotten worse while riding a horse there..."      on-inline-comments-modal">

</p><p data-p-id="7f5a4514d738a3c82b099011a6bd9055">"Really?" <br>Ran jumped up, and Lumiere nodded after thinking for a while.      on-inline-comments-modal">

</p><p data-p-id="6ce8d54545aa97c4250693d93dcc3848">"I saw he pause slightly when he got on the horse." Lumiere kissed the back of her hand.      on-inline-comments-modal">

</p><p data-p-id="66ad5f1d4a3b4d5e66e3471c0d29ec72">Ran didn't know what to say, so she took a beat off and said,      on-inline-comments-modal">

</p><p data-p-id="b260615fc1b4cba53b88b19343513439">With a wink in his right eye, Ran once again said, "Thank you," and headed quickly into the mansion.      on-inline-comments-modal">

</p><p data-p-id="93830a7ab78304a30e1288f1fbf1ae9b">Before going to Eustaf's room, Ran stopped by a therapist. When she went up to his room, the servant politely informed her that he was still in the bath, and Ran sat on the sofa and waited. <br>Waiting with her feet clapping, Eustaf came out without drying his hair.      on-inline-comments-modal">
