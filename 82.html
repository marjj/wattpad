</p><p data-p-id="ab3d056663f3b85a36ce9c9241c6d11e">'It's useless!'


</p><p data-p-id="5bb962da2d4ae6c0dec0ffc6fe8be404">Ran squeezed her hair. This was all the mention of the Viridescent Crown.


</p><p data-p-id="aff14cc151637cd26110852b8fd857d0">Iveria has repeatedly told me that she is sorry for taking on such a promising job in a place like this. My wife said it was okay. Iveria said to me, "You liked Delphanto, too," and I couldn't answer.


</p><p data-p-id="c6da4c8c0d2241417d52a4ef83fbce58">As soon as Ran discovered the name, she remembered it clearly.

</p><p data-p-id="ba69e343f83b2de0fc57bd495ac7d1a8">It was the name of the Darkness, the author sealed on the ice wall.


</p><p data-p-id="eeafa055ccb600a13a6057f94d8c9200">'A nasty guy who was a lover to the great sage, Iveria, but who was also sealed.'


</p><p data-p-id="4cb83adf1fecbf6ae384113488a68338">Ran thought so and sighed. She now took a sip of the cold tea and began to concentrate on the book again.


</p><p data-p-id="7184d22b7bf057d302d0665f7f241a4c">The content itself was quite exciting, but no more <br>Delphanto stories came out. About seals and ice walls. <br>Ran covered the book and put it in the bookshelf.


</p><p data-p-id="0d2c11e98843d53fd57b93287f28b3cc">'Let's take a look at the crown.'


</p><p data-p-id="b1148a3f752287e6329bd57cf5835754">I have seen it once or twice when I was young. It was because the Duchess of Lazia had been wearing it once or twice.

</p><p data-p-id="fe5ac60f38aead192c744cc468733f90">Ran stretched herself out. She got up from her seat, stretched around, and breathed out a long breath.


</p><p data-p-id="2995f00fffa44778abfe4b64d6f22b47">'I should stop here for today. and send letters to the wizards to ask questions. ·······.'


</p><p data-p-id="f1f4eb8f7cd5c21ed81e209f3cf333a5">Ran left the library.

</p><p data-p-id="626e09e3544cd1ab4ea1829637bacdda">He looked at the snow with such thoughts.


</p><p data-p-id="601747a1028491d0438f978e763347a3">The snow piled up in the trees and stood like a strange sculpture, and the snow was not hard and fell in.


</p><p data-p-id="016d06f1255f57aab6151d9c09075c4a">"Koake (the ostrich-looking masu, the head looks like a chicken and spews poison) is too smart for a crowd."


</p><p data-p-id="6f38f55ce6388e56f7885adc3952b228">Ross nodded at Eustaf's words.


</p><p data-p-id="3da2a6e59b65b912eac24e9b536660eb">"A bunch of people are divided, and some of them are sent separately to dazzle them."


</p><p data-p-id="d396bac5f227c2c7eb3cfb16dd1f8e97">Ross looked at the forest in front of him.


</p><p data-p-id="70f2358259db90b204d6aa68579da3fe">"I feel like I'm running into a trap."


</p><p data-p-id="e40d2903bbf6edfefce442fbce6894dc">When Eustaf turned around, Lumiere smiled. Eustaf did not like the relaxed smile, but he was a good leader and knew the difference between public and private.

</p><p data-p-id="b8656cf76cc12afbe502173ff7151385">"Yes, don't you think they're being lured in a certain direction? I don't know much about Masu."
