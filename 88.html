<p data-p-id="9f1f085dc5ef2a23ad7c143a57a913db">Soda and Kara alternately said with their red eyes, "She's not coming out of the bed." "She's just crying," and Dimodia and Kiri shook their heads slightly.


</p><p data-p-id="a84ab969520254b890eaaab2c3889d4a">The therapist also only said, "I'm sorry, sir," when asked about the possibility of her eyes being fixed.


</p><p data-p-id="3489545b370fd4d436b50243dd7fab85">No, it may actually be that I didn't have the courage to come see her during the day. I really wanted to see Lan, but I didn't want to hear her curse at him.


</p><p data-p-id="8b813dd2077c68b7d973a3ea30807904">So, I came to see you at night.....


</p><p data-p-id="8dc0dc556dd443b1aa5a7f65912bbc8c">'Sneaking.'


</p><p data-p-id="2a2906df77c359ac34214f80d707884b">Towards himself, Eustaf looked at Lan with self-help.


</p><p data-p-id="85ad7b39a349dc86599aae0faaf55864">She was wearing a lace-up pajama. The golden hair had been left out for a long time, so it was flowing down her back.


</p><p data-p-id="1c0511831bb7871f054237205e1bbd4b">Her slender calves and white bare feet were visible because of her pajamas that slightly covered her knees. <br>The focusless emerald eyes shone under the dim light.


</p><p data-p-id="e64b7f3150260aa7a065e9532e89c613">Lan, who had been walking carefully one step at a time, stumbled over what was caught, and Eustaf ran out without realizing it and caught her.


</p><p data-p-id="aea0ff9e2aa609ccc72f2865c7ecf0bc">Lan opened her eyes wide.


</p><p data-p-id="e94265d4c5b953ce8853fcfa446fa472">There was silence between the two, caught and held.


</p><p data-p-id="d5ec650cda5514c5559254c3804946b8">Lan began to grope up his arms with her fingertips, holding onto his waist. Her white fingertips touched his shoulder, then his neck and face.


</p><p data-p-id="74742d92393b0852baf2a5eeeccbfd8f">Lan gently and delicately stroked his face and smiled.


</p><p data-p-id="514fb9f6dacdfef3e0c126fda6c5e6f7">"What, it was Youth?"


</p><p data-p-id="b0e6bc8030848039ca1203b330061f27">The smile came into Eustaf's heart and loded in it.


</p><p data-p-id="4ee7953b5ea3ed5b4420997b0bac4784">Every breath, the ice pieces swallowed seemed to melt away. The pain that was touching the heart disappeared, and everything just melted down. <br>A smile on her face, a word of no concern.


</p><p data-p-id="312fb35e5378e80f78cc84eef4503907">Lan's fingers gently scattered his eyes and cheeks and pressed his lips.


</p><p data-p-id="174987d88c757ba50e47ea1842bc6bf3">"Youth, right?"


</p><p data-p-id="daa99b3f7a30c7559938adce9fdae27a">An uneasy look flashed across her face, and Eustaf barely responded, "Yes."


</p><p data-p-id="eb45d1de3ea27b0876cd72b55d903cfd">I felt my voice shaking even though it was a short answer.


</p><p data-p-id="64f0793129cbef199e04ded55aa26757">"But why didn't you just pretend you didn't know?"


</p><p data-p-id="aa7fa0d9d21f7cc68615d7e4980542fd">"I'm afraid you'll be surprised."


</p><p data-p-id="9bd525dfd3ebdfe69c81a07e2ca49860">The words came out more smoothly than before. Eustaf carefully coughed and said.


</p><p data-p-id="70f5328d983c8a4ada441e5b753655a8">"Can I go to the couch?"


</p><p data-p-id="1078e818fbab2f22ae89ccfdc499e20b">"Yes" <br>Lan nodded her head gently. Then she opened her arms.


</p><p data-p-id="b9314e7338644db6c760fa4580ba1ce4">"I can't walk."


</p><p data-p-id="1864bda5e378ce9466fef3a070fba438">Eustaf smiled and hugged her without realizing it. For a moment, he briefly flinched at the warmth and tenderness of bare skin over her thin silk cloth, then sighed and moved her to the sofa.


</p><p data-p-id="f986f6c2fff6321d777d314e2778a9be">Lan stuck her arm around his neck and didn't fall off.


</p><p data-p-id="11eb76874ab2bbb97f92da51711521a1">I didn't want to be away because I couldn't see it.


</p><p data-p-id="29397e4c593ca667cc1e3c22c9b35433">Eustaf asked, slowly sweeping her back.


</p><p data-p-id="cda5fc9bb9d7958dd88fa1c50795cb4d">"Did you have a nightmare?"


</p><p data-p-id="2459a04ea575aec885bc527be3b866d2">"Huh? Yeah, falling dreams."


</p><p data-p-id="852a5f2d8e11929beacab54dcab24f2e">Eustaf flinched at her words. He hugged her and said.


</p><p data-p-id="ad1e10da7f54858525be29ea7fc1509e">"I'm here." <br>Lan smiled lightly and said,


</p><p data-p-id="12b7676f06f4fcb16db5b4da7804f01e">"Youth"


</p><p data-p-id="4ab998b30ccb1c13c6a053be209959e4">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="92c3a163396abc3bc587f8914ed57012">"By any chance...."


</p><p data-p-id="65a869072e54c6a6205b309cfd494980">"Tell me."


</p><p data-p-id="f5b270f82f4ed24160190688cd3f2456">"Sina, did you meet her?"


</p>

<p data-p-id="2897c29adb550beaab32ca285fe65551">Eustaf almost asked back who it was for a moment, but managed to find out that it was the name of the woman Lan had asked to save.


</p><p data-p-id="273407a2a0a79e001db92657e99476ef">When he heard the report, he only glanced at it, but he never talked properly.


</p><p data-p-id="8063e4ca45b688298523c8fa4deb01c7">But now that I know Lan cares, I can't say that, so Eustaf answered cautiously.


</p><p data-p-id="48bc6035e65c9ea074f8b18ad7cc656c">"I met."


</p><p data-p-id="3d9037fc348b85a2dc6ff912729c4089">"·······How·····?"


</p><p data-p-id="3fb3822576cdd13e361de16604a6d404">"She seem like a good man." I don't know, but anyway.


</p><p data-p-id="0ab886a4d8254180b76fd39f986c89e4">I don't know why, but in this situation, Lan even knows her name, he cares about her very much, and if so, I didn't want to swear.


</p><p data-p-id="20b41aeea89809ea17e0d46c5b8acb4f">"...Is that so..."


</p><p data-p-id="62ab29abec9abb5fe437a13208baf5fe">Lan muttered like that and buried her face on his shoulder.


</p><p data-p-id="e1106dcbce6571f41d64d9d44db33b07">"Youth"


</p><p data-p-id="1a0ceb7935bc827c6efec6a972f10404">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="3dfccb731130417afe29ad55298ff18d">"Shall we sleep?"


</p><p data-p-id="61e955b869b283d950fb46a9d2dbae18">"Would you like to sleep?"


</p><p data-p-id="f0a133c2afeed8388e0501e4d2824e60">"No, it's not-"


</p><p data-p-id="426dae6933bef9d1f54866f0b987fd1f">Lan raised her head and kissed him after she caress his face with her fingertips.


</p><p data-p-id="534d5589504b1e939fce9a177df09ba5">"Shall we sleep?"


</p><p data-p-id="02cb8d16f53d71ecddf5c6c374c6051b">The meaning of what she asked again was so clear that Eustaf was silent for a moment.


</p><p data-p-id="f2091f20daf3ae5d279ed40a22637171">Lan thought it was fortunate that nothing was seen. In the dark, people could be much more brazen than they thought.


</p><p data-p-id="b6ad879dddd594811115b307099b16f6">Ran listened to the sound of breathing in silence after saying such a thing without a blush.


</p><p data-p-id="ccf065cebf0770fdfb33b6805e8ed90f">Eustaf held her waist strongly. His lips touched her cheek gently and he whispered.


</p><p data-p-id="18e8f863ef14dd11edebcdc49d8d8cfb">"Is that what you're proposing?"


</p><p data-p-id="7ac2ebf9af05ce0ea21ae3c0e4e60967">"......Huh?"


</p><p data-p-id="1726eb53e7fff6bd5fabbdba5ee7a1dc">Lan replied a beat later, embarrassed by the unexpected words. Lan couldn't tell whether she was joking or not.


</p><p data-p-id="c30aa94214d9005109356ee401e7abd2">Eustaf's lips brushed her cheek and gently pressed her eyes past the cheekbone.


</p><p data-p-id="30fe275bec34117baa9b8d62ce9a262a">"Or is there something else I don't know?"


</p><p data-p-id="c62df486c840e44af5193e16f2ec7e21">Lan was speechless for a moment.<br><br>"Or did I seem shameless to sleep with someone other than you?"


</p><p data-p-id="c0e3281cbd737d74680b877b471a9bc7">I saw my father do such a thing as much as he could, and I saw how my mother was ruined. It was disgusting because I couldn't hate it.<br><br>Lan stammered.


</p><p data-p-id="2ad2e5511abff289034c65a76364c9ca">"Marriage?"


</p><p data-p-id="81f3fae0e3a98ff5027eeb135d7d3c1c">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="904581a366876357161cacd1c02b5644">After answering, Eustaf took a deep breath for a while and asked.


</p><p data-p-id="c3d382417bb13f48addb1d7c44929148">"Weren't we supposed to be engaged this spring?"


</p><p data-p-id="ff1658637fa4fe56615133e2b82e5333">"It has been....., but....."


</p><p data-p-id="a572749ce7d7a0008eeff0fa0ab021a9">"Hate it?"


</p><p data-p-id="938d737ef6a3335b326c6aae874c0a2c">Eustaf's voice was calm, so Lan shut her mouth. Eustaf looked down at Lan's face without saying a word.


</p><p data-p-id="1cd55ba531d7ad4f348d6fafe70340ec">After a long breath, Lan decided to speak her mind honestly.


</p><p data-p-id="761d754f0921fa343645386b7037747e">"Youth"


</p><p data-p-id="631842d2c9f25b831cc89f40b76cd216">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="b9d2850c7fb6ec911403e7ace461526c">"Do you still like me?"


</p><p data-p-id="f83065501939007cc25240eba0fd4777">This is what I wanted to check. At Lan's words, Eustaf held her chin and kissed her roughly. Lan opened her eyes wide.


</p><p data-p-id="a5bc1e03924f3c03a474dc2dbb85ec13">It was a rough and persistent kiss. His large palm swept from her back to her waist, grabbed her back neck, and came deeper.


</p><p data-p-id="fcdb1151fa19f2b1ecd9200dce60e075">Tears welled up by excessive stimulation.


</p><p data-p-id="3f73efb481d9d130940a77214e4e52c2">Lan grabbed him by the shoulder and twisted his body, and Eustaf pressed her down on the sofa.


</p><p data-p-id="d0939a1f7dad15b52475394d19986d33">"Oh, Youth-"


</p>

<p data-p-id="17589732db1c44ee3d71fe5cf87bd09c">A kiss continued again even before the word was finished.


</p><p data-p-id="22960120d30525272295745519ad3577">Since I couldn't see, everything became more sensitive, so Lan couldn't breathe.


</p><p data-p-id="6d5f1772c2ab68959dce6b06a9a3f119">The weight and heat that he pushed her down on the sofa forced Lan to groan and hug him tightly.


</p><p data-p-id="b9b79680c30ebf7bd3013dc6f427a94b">Rather than scary, a strange relief enveloped her.


</p><p data-p-id="b7d6ceb471381c3c847426e3d344d8c4">Under him she was perfectly safe. <br>He finished kissing, swallowed a rough breath, kissed her on the cheek and whispered in her ear.


</p><p data-p-id="fdaf39be63e55167aef9cf6be09fb746">"No, it's more than like."


</p><p data-p-id="b8de897074678f813754e01ff3fe827a">Lan smiled without realizing it. His weight, the heat, was pleasant.


</p><p data-p-id="1b55ed1baf9897ef88f839830a35fa05">I feel like my heart is full.


</p><p data-p-id="becd1dd5f6c6dae87144ee44f292c337">"But I'm blind-"


</p><p data-p-id="38611fde26caf3a50ff124075fb9ef43">When she said carefully, "I have eyes," replied Eustaf.


</p><p data-p-id="42e9651a0d7979845a8c944f4dbe5dc8">"Youth"


</p><p data-p-id="95ac05aae81c70576b1a1383f6766247">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="6ab8292a4f9d4d84c473c228f6b2b315">Lan's hands came up from his back to his shoulders from his neck to his cheeks and wrapped them around his cheeks.


</p><p data-p-id="9c6b0dbce06c13dfde7c357949fdff2d">Trying to focus on the invisible man, Lan thanked it for not being seen.


</p><p data-p-id="d9b901ce118aaa61d9d58d0fb4b53116">"If you like someone else, be honest with me then."


</p><p data-p-id="d2d79fa30055a98b88b52f3de5e59399">"That's not happening."


</p><p data-p-id="91bc5772639a6e89f0c2f85c5b1e6dae">Eustaf replied with a frown.


</p><p data-p-id="3b7320215f1e836a3ff453c086484823">"You don't know that."


</p><p data-p-id="519b34b31719e3403ca0dc3e5984ba95">At Lan's words, Eustaf said firmly.


</p><p data-p-id="4c8df766daa13d588f22b9fc6251efb3">"Maybe for some people, but not for me."


</p><p data-p-id="4913b65223f28e7b2efc4a614565c421">He grabbed her wrist, turned his head, gently kissing her palms.


</p><p data-p-id="a01b11a57ff4093c8e0345ced9613e34">"If you want to leave Lazia-" His voice broke.


</p><p data-p-id="cd7dc3a878755f46ec88dbeb91c5bcb5">"Be honest with me."


</p><p data-p-id="7ab90aa6cdea9baf9c47ace387e0126c">"I don't want to leave."


</p><p data-p-id="afb75b822f28ecf3d45b1dd71ace7ce6">"Then please stay."


</p><p data-p-id="bc27c63df7b1a6c7c4b41282363239e4">Saying as if pleading, Eustaf lived and kissed her forehead.


</p><p data-p-id="960a8395cf10325eff2215b4c1a1040e">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="d29cc04bd4072082b64dac9c6d0ab2e0">Lan answered quietly and smiled faintly. I felt like my strength was escaping from my body.


</p><p data-p-id="1cd612c3a00d439024fd52d6413ce68c">Eustaf met Sinah.


</p><p data-p-id="056eb0a1dcc17e5ef801d3eb5e633803">He also said she was a good person. <br>But he still likes me.


</p><p data-p-id="7044dd6e56752d7776b68716047d28bf">'And now your eyes will be better.'


</p><p data-p-id="33bc32647bcc2dbed5159aa8f98c7beb">Oh, I should say this to him.


</p><p data-p-id="9b937f337d89173fd668bb2c76a61053">However, I felt so sleepy that I couldn't bear it, probably because I was relaxed at once.


</p><p data-p-id="4bf8d5bc449f7f4179d01ba33f643715">Lan fell asleep as if she were fainting. Suddenly, Lan drooped and Eustaf caught her in surprise, but soon found out that she was only asleep.


</p><p data-p-id="136c82b2fe572c8e0dffab0ff8365f02">"Replacement...."


</p><p data-p-id="be2e1e58f78244b37edc770f8c03f470">He sighed and held her carefully. <br>Her hand grabbing the hem of his clothes as he moved her down to bed. I think it'll fall out if I sneak it out, but I didn't want to, so Eustaf sat next to her bed.


</p><p data-p-id="f09f57818fe87c9b480b21d1bbf50341">And he watched Lan fall asleep for a long time until she let go of his clothes, or even after he left, and left her side until dawn.


</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******


</p><p data-p-id="e9c8e127ffd11c554e1b8aa3d380eac8">When Lan came to her senses, her maids also cheered up. After dressing up from head to toe, Lan decided to meet Sina.


</p><p data-p-id="b67904758843b0935ba68a471048cf96">At the words, Lumiere explained Sinah to Lan with a strange look.


</p><p data-p-id="58568418570403c6c855cb66a1100cd4">"She claims she's from another world."


</p><p data-p-id="53402ad348f3c23cb3113f37c7a8d4e8">"Really?"


</p><p data-p-id="622aa39c57b9fe7100415d1cafa66dae">"Yes, and-" <br>Lumiere sighed.


</p>

<p data-p-id="cd17023898845961c72320501a624581">"That's a pretty good idea. I haven't seen anything she's wearing or anything she has."


</p><p data-p-id="cbca70860ff2cde32fc741816358ad7b">"I see." <br>Lan nodded.


</p><p data-p-id="5e82121e3684203c4a9949fa01dd3957">It's because she's from another world. In addition, Lan noticed the familiarity in her voice.


</p><p data-p-id="d4f4eaeaa2f54bee09cb6d8e5a9e3f47">'This is how the fish in the fishing grounds enter.'


</p><p data-p-id="174961105c49c3732b665f9fa89bab04">Lan put her chin on her face, pawed and smirked. But she didn't say that.<br><br>"Okay, thanks for the story."


</p><p data-p-id="324c80981fea7becfdfaaec83013c7ab">Lumiere stared at Lan at her words.<br><br>"Master."


</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"


</p><p data-p-id="81bd69807f017e81772f6b57d9b74089">"Is the box still in the drawer?"


</p><p data-p-id="64150392a520405eb95b44bef4c5b8d7">He casually asked, and Lan blinked and replied, "Yes."


</p><p data-p-id="945017d613c88de40962e08833bac7f3">"You don't want to use it?"


</p><p data-p-id="bb5b77d25060eb66391521f5e9d3efa7">Lan was embarrassed but asked with a smile.


</p><p data-p-id="e3d96b0c21be00ce2cbaa3e0c934cdb0">"Why? Do you want it, Lumie?"


</p><p data-p-id="88723ac10c9db8babd15d5fdd9a0191d">"Lachia is dangerous."


</p><p data-p-id="d0a0df7abdf1734c4ae23fa2bf536d6c">At her words, Lan opened his mouth slightly, "Ah." It was.


</p><p data-p-id="76d2b507746786d1e9d0d928d9dba56e">It's dangerous.


</p><p data-p-id="3024a9c959337719c5d75a1f97072995">But-


</p><p data-p-id="4642400120e1aaa2adc68e0f3c8d9eb9">"My precious things are all here."


</p><p data-p-id="8bfd4f258c0c7709a4aa49a41d8d6fc2">I heard Lumiere sighing at Lan's words.


</p><p data-p-id="7a2abce34d1fdf2b39bb34b49c2cb391">"All right"


</p><p data-p-id="8bd964ac45af2dea2d53d5cdfeca9390">He answered and asked carefully.


</p><p data-p-id="41d0a38b1e5e7f7a26d3eaf8fc9c6e20">"Can I help you move?"


</p><p data-p-id="25d6a0c8b3abc799ba97d32db9f7b11f">"Of course."


</p><p data-p-id="743bb44a9fb2ff983646568345aae195">Lan reached out his hand, and Lumiere held her hand and raised her arm on his arm.


</p><p data-p-id="9ea217aba4328770bf74808ba36ad24c">With their arms crossed, the two began to walk. Lan tried everything, it was most comfortable to walk holding someone's arm.


</p><p data-p-id="47b65e370fa816d0712d4bdccf7452df">When the stairs came out, Eustaf and Lumie took her down the stairs as if it were natural.


</p><p data-p-id="0025d8f728852b3aef0df8989b10e776">I was embarrassed, but I didn't hate it, but Lan used to hug them calmly. <br>As I entered the room, I heard a bustling sound.


</p><p data-p-id="c03a9b88164579da3de14fdc5e887cbe">"Hello!"


</p><p data-p-id="3a5fa7b1581c542356e8dc1213381b22">A cheerful voice, too.


</p><p data-p-id="3c7dd0505af8cf6b65fb135932b6b0c7">Lan laughed without realizing it.


</p><p data-p-id="ca35385b99fc7cc7f2fa0991168e3fe0">"Hello, nice to meet you. My name is Ran Romia."


</p><p data-p-id="cfd8c0f2deb5804cb9f273f354c9a568">"My name is Sina. Ishina. My last name is Lee. You can just call me Sina."


</p><p data-p-id="4559b618e604699fc0d336bf50ac0643">"You can just call me Lan, too."


</p><p data-p-id="355a872f21988f626c620b06b2dd7268">Lumiere led her to the chair, so Lan sat on the chair carefully.


</p><p data-p-id="654730d3d5a88ea4fd818cc3dea53413">"Sina, please sit down."


</p><p data-p-id="7c9134640fc53842283dd8817582bf3e">At Lan's words, Sina sat in front of her and stared at Lan.


</p><p data-p-id="67d563c7a6a37e88749e4946b07e3221">"Respect..."


</p><p data-p-id="c98041d736e04581121d54b26ba79225">Lan shook her shoulders and coughed when Sina murmured without realizing it. Or I would laugh.


</p><p data-p-id="2b1ce468737f01b58189e40ecfef3d31">"I heard Miss Sina says she's from another world."


</p><p data-p-id="cf44cb8db0e6e3a686380fdc11639f59">At Lan's words, Sina nodded, then hurriedly replied,


</p><p data-p-id="dec19e0691c228131baa1d6baa4debf4">"Yes."


</p><p data-p-id="2a83acb5d49b9328ac6382e5f22bed59">With blonde hair and unlikely green eyes, the beauty was somehow friendly to her.


</p><p data-p-id="0f1fe740b11f5ba37cd4d3546a86c32f">Sina swallowed her saliva. <br>You have to do well here. Or maybe they're driven by witches or something to watch.


</p><p data-p-id="effa168e5a334c0a20e9b3fccfa8a3ef">Sina started talking to Ran as she explained to Lumiere several times. <br>Lan listened with a serious face and listened without interrupting her.


</p><p data-p-id="58c5b76fb2fd2390577cae2bb1f5b119">"So, I don't know what happened. I heard that there is no wizard in Lazia. I want to go back to the original world. Can you help me?"


</p><p data-p-id="ba4561c99b931eb16b3eb8e55733e353">When she desperately added her last words, Lan remained silent for a while and nodded.


</p><p data-p-id="8ce91597c641ec9ac3d1c0f0a1a544d1">"All right"


</p><p data-p-id="9e60125cc6165ab8b98933849b98cc17">"Really?"


</p><p data-p-id="ac105b75598cd2ef361e820e98a0aa05">Sina jumped up from her seat and pulled her hand. Lan was surprised, but Sina didn't notice and waved her hand.


</p><p data-p-id="0c807161e35c729e09c3555e60c5d3e0">"Thank, thank you very much, thank you, heuk, heuk-"


</p><p data-p-id="5aa72d3190cbf9a48bcd819cbccbc68c">The voice began to mix with crying, so Lan got up from her seat and stuttered cautiously to find Sina's shoulder.


</p><p data-p-id="07705795783b7134caf013f86694d4d0">"It's okay. It'll work out."


</p><p data-p-id="1c21b3ffcd9a94c3898641611d2c9953">Come to think of it, how scary would it be?


</p><p data-p-id="181478c997a17a654080c641d7f74f9f">Lan thought so and patted her on the back, and Sina soon hugged her and began to cry loudly.


</p><p data-p-id="b490276ba1d7eb83cc09896869596660">Lan opened her eyes wide and smiled and said, "It's okay. I'll help you now," whispered.


</p><p data-p-id="bb45a267b6e93b2551b706a20f364950">Lumiere remembered his past while watching it.


</p><p data-p-id="068f9969b46df2af8aa7fec970ad5e2a">'You'll have another human like me.'<br><br>He looked at Sina, who was crying in Lan's arms with such thoughts. And Lan, who smiles while sweeping her back.


</p><p data-p-id="45da0f309076998db702f26ba9ee2303">His heart ached, so he lowered his gaze.


</p><p data-p-id="e9b46d9439a604d88a1510c5219d9dcf">"Tha, thank you."


</p><p data-p-id="cfe2c653928c05023486ae49d885ffe1">Sina wiped her face with Lan's handkerchief.


</p><p data-p-id="6a8fce116e9d7b55d7862a572d15b483">I was ashamed to hear that I was hugged by a stranger and cried out loud. However, the anxiety has been somewhat washed away, and my mind has returned.
