<p data-p-id="3f1478e422f1e868d1f1bcde674acc80">"Ah-- about the death of Emperor Ruth..."

</p><p data-p-id="d0df64ce70c961d1c2aa13c5524956d3">Lan flinched at the words and asked.

</p><p data-p-id="4dd5777b1b6f633bdc9499c70e11614d">"What strange rumor is going around?"

</p><p data-p-id="383850b529667ac949f3ebab05d16a5c">"Oh my? you didn't know?"

</p><p data-p-id="ac704e8cd9a2f68565ce1231bfab984d">Levery opened her eyes round and said, "Oh, you were in <br>Lazia."

</p><p data-p-id="08899d301f5e4ceed7ccc226a8508c5d">"I heard he died enjoying with Cortizan and a crazy party. It's a trend these days to drink alcohol with medicine."

</p><p data-p-id="ea9059515221fb21a31e98f21ca05df7">Levery blew her nose.

</p><p data-p-id="3854e5b836bed5645ab5d2c61e660c49">"And then he overdosed. When he woke up from playing drunk, he was surprised and called a doctor. Come to think of it, he's dead. It's this. It's even naked?"

</p><p data-p-id="15dcafab38a65154ffb15524a58c2cd0">Lan opened her mouth wide. It was the first news she heard. Levery lowered her voice.

</p><p data-p-id="ce20a4247e3dda5fd2f851ad3a8762fc">"So the Empress fell when she heard the news, and she didn't even come back to the Miro's family. Cortizan and the illegitimate child disappeared without knowing the mouse or bird, and the Duke of Miro took care of them."

</p><p data-p-id="ee275dae92536221fb2b48c767e8a02f">"It's such a thing...."

</p><p data-p-id="4ac55044d889c8b4a426250cd28c3179">"Well, I can't say that the Emperor died while taking medicine with being weak with a spear, so I just said he died of heart attack and he was hissing."

</p><p data-p-id="724b20e8be08ffdf995458deef9316a9">"Oh, my God."

</p><p data-p-id="8378aee836d392d2c9d800ece62f5023">Lan sighed.

</p><p data-p-id="5fbb0f68a62cb259b559e8c561e453a0">'But I don't think there's a rumor that Eustaf killed him.'

</p><p data-p-id="335d6b5d0f45e30a73d90a7ad34f62d1">That's a relief, she said, and Levery gathered his eyebrows to lower his voice.

</p><p data-p-id="ff4fd8e3bf1f8e87734eefd11251fcca">"And Emperor Ruth's father, the Emperor Sun."

</p><p data-p-id="dec19e0691c228131baa1d6baa4debf4">"Yes."

</p><p data-p-id="1d616912f0710f134c7e08df71a8ace5">"Your Majesty Ruth is involved in his death...."

</p><p data-p-id="14f0c96c7f8d20a11f227fa74c3219c0">Lan was so surprised that she swallowed her breath.

</p><p data-p-id="53402ad348f3c23cb3113f37c7a8d4e8">"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="7f13362e15024b0701f1b0b4d2683b10">"There's a lot of rumors going around here. I can't say it out loud because it could be an insult to the imperial family."

</p><p data-p-id="ebbf3c09a881e10c259291c36ad3373b">Levery grinned and raised her glass.

</p><p data-p-id="9b726a37f3023226b9c00f011fa00afa">"This time, the Emperor, Prince Label, is a wise man, and I hope he will keep his guard for a long time."

</p><p data-p-id="e736f8a5011e212e474832da1bca22d7">At Levery's words, Lan nodded earnestly.

</p><p data-p-id="867fb60640f7541db35022bf681a60e2">"I hope so, too."

</p><p data-p-id="d82cdfc8e7d0296b81b0aaa8a0a67c7e">Levery grinned and stood up from her seat and said.

</p><p data-p-id="fbd14a22b69fd159fc7179b4580395cb">"I heard you sang a lot of songs besides me."

</p><p data-p-id="d95652ca613541170fa3568fc221c72f">"Yes?"

</p><p data-p-id="1b34ef6f457a6774e139ec5939c8f12c">"There were people waiting outside from the boutique."

</p><p data-p-id="9e60125cc6165ab8b98933849b98cc17">"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="71d3a75647f2860d0cc024a3849d4c83">Lan opened her eyes wide and said with an elegant smile afterwards.

</p><p data-p-id="cd435c1abd7ef6ece837d6f94663a7e2">"He builds gold and silver treasures where his heart is. <br>You're loved, Earl."

</p><p data-p-id="9931ee85361829ee77d4ffabfe78206b">Lan's cheeks turned red and Levery smiled back.

</p><p data-p-id="0225c70ae620f9d03e99de020cce8e31">And as Levery said, as soon as the meeting with her ended, merchants came in in line.

</p><p data-p-id="10cb9b79edf11b6743145c36f4dc73a0">From head to toe, hectic shopping continued.

</p><p data-p-id="f94a4dbca80e313adbbccaa7a9c164e3">If Sina and Dimodia hadn't taken care of Lan's spirit hard, they would have given up on the way.

</p><p data-p-id="25c846f39a8b139a1cc541d843255761">Lan got tired after shopping all day.

</p><p data-p-id="c969b030ba8b10a2077e12248699f727">"I'm tired!"

</p><p data-p-id="71492eb3b835336e81787ff2ca65c625">Sina said with a smile as Lan shouted.

</p><p data-p-id="b7b9ae464823c4884e6cec38e09a9373">"Then eat something delicious!"

</p><p data-p-id="8d553bc7730a6266b82afc717b07acaf">"Shall we? I want to eat the souffle hot cake I had before. There's citrus tea."

</p>

<p data-p-id="3009232b403f0e6130b6c326155165ba">Dimodia quickly got up from her seat and pulled the rope.

</p><p data-p-id="afe6fd955e18886b87b626cf6ce44bb1">"I'll tell them to make it right away."<br><br>Sina asked, "Don't you think souffle will take a long time?"

</p><p data-p-id="7d9423c92cb374518980108303250b1a">Lan said, pointing to the scattered catalogs. "I think it's going to be enough time to sort that out."

</p><p data-p-id="a0c2f52e357466f6f4ed8123b2775dd3">Sina nodded in agreement.

</p><p data-p-id="d64e2c2395d510d0fb705ba5e8049b1c">Madame Klein brought a doll today was the biggest hit.

</p><p data-p-id="89cbbf8df0aa3907f66272eeac350746">She brought ten dolls about 60 centimeters tall, all dressed from head to toe in elaborate dresses. <br>In short, the liver is a mannequin.

</p><p data-p-id="7b7b3cfa599009a139275d853b88f3ee">Lan ordered about three or four of them, and Madame Klein gave the doll as a gift.

</p><p data-p-id="2e8ebee2e79e04718cb694d285c25c65">"This doll is amazing....."

</p><p data-p-id="56bc2eaae25d7560fae66776fca28a36">As Lan murmured, Dimodia peeked at the dress and said.

</p><p data-p-id="31881a6502c948d98ee57aa6a133e042">"And the petticoat inside, look, it's laced."

</p><p data-p-id="1879a2cda9b4d1237ca1321fc4255713">"Really? Oh, my God."

</p><p data-p-id="112a30ed41e11e60dc34f7ebfe736604">"Oh, my God? The Drawers, too."

</p><p data-p-id="99d22ae6933f326e554712beb6f305ef">Even though he was curious in front of others, Lan was amazed by Dimodia's words.

</p><p data-p-id="9d1ab95abb005ad33c9524da04107034">"It's going to be popular among young ladies."

</p><p data-p-id="445e9385b41d6fb017bed9822909f036">Lan nodded at Dimodia's words.

</p><p data-p-id="76e76211a534a6be5723df0e3ae827cc">"Yes, the price must be quite high." Lan shook her head.

</p><p data-p-id="8f9948df518ec284249f7de6c053a8f1">Time went by quickly when I saw the doll, passed the catalog, commented on the clothes I chose today, and talked about the accessories to fit it.

</p><p data-p-id="1d372413fda177f8b0acdb40e3aadaf7">So when I cleaned up the sample cloth and catalog, the dessert came out just right.

</p><p data-p-id="a293044bb1e5ddade1fb88249249734e">When I sprayed syrup on a fluffy souffle hot cake and cut it with a big fork and put it in my mouth, I quickly felt happy.

</p><p data-p-id="73e7ec206194032318f19abdade644ad">Kiri came in with a bundle of letters saying, <br>"Oh, my God, is it syrup again on sweets?"

</p><p data-p-id="278578880199ad0fc9934e096ad8f92c">Normally, I would collect them politely on silver plates and upload them, but I agreed to omit Lan or efficiency because Kiri is the type of person who values efficiency.

</p><p data-p-id="11665b32a740c25ed8a5b05457597b8f">"Did you organize my letters?"

</p><p data-p-id="52d114e550e9cf839decfaf0dda075b0">"Yes, we've got a lot of invitations, but there aren't that many places to go. It might be better to open it yourself." Kiri then lifted the most luxurious envelope.

</p><p data-p-id="d5fccb8de6496d8079e5cc7a96c8bed2">"And when are you going to answer the invitation from the Empress?"

</p><p data-p-id="965ec8c1518f7c844cd75073c550b3fb">"Katya, the Empress."

</p><p data-p-id="16fef9f5268e1e4a4a92572372dfcd16">"Yes, she is also the mother of the current Emperor."

</p><p data-p-id="4b766e5fc9293d85c9829d11fc08a3d7">That's why it's safe to have more than one son. Kiri crushed her shoulder.

</p><p data-p-id="55eccc98c9de193643a9b107e8ab8458">Lan thought about it for a while and nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="d66f15c97f831fd18dd2e5532b5c134f">"I'll write back to see her."

</p><p data-p-id="c8ea96eb349b2b35f98f06ecdaeefc4a">Your husband is dead and your son is dead, so you must be sorry. It was considered polite to visit.

</p><p data-p-id="c66b2830be8532060c100a7bb5353668">'You helped push Olivia away.'

</p><p data-p-id="701ccb399e2a2bef1c9c96869ff67b9c">At Lan's words, Kiri said, "All right," and asked with another envelope.

</p><p data-p-id="f24a903d818a2918e40ae44e5d3f2a16">"What about the invitation of Countess Lieselotti-?"

</p><p data-p-id="07e46ab173334c454d7868176f511bf5">Lan smiled and shook her hand by dragging her back word strangely.

</p><p data-p-id="408bd125d57f20301dfa8f4049da063d">"Say it's done. I have a bad memory."

</p><p data-p-id="b0bf2056917d7d6842fd59012206eb7a">Lan whispered to Sina and saw Kiri again.

</p><p data-p-id="ae4960b04cbfde01750156a6a79faacc">Kiri called the name of the person who sent the invitation in turn, and Lan decided whether to go or not.

</p>

<p data-p-id="93d88ff57e27ede38fee9d4d3ff6324c">After handing over the last invitation, Kiri asked.

</p><p data-p-id="9585d6b96ad90a56362b237a86065571">"What are you going to do?"

</p><p data-p-id="cf293129d428eee698f74440f93bfe84">"What?"

</p><p data-p-id="1998eea9913803aecbeaf00a9a4c4a06">"Are you holding a meeting at the Green Arch?"

</p><p data-p-id="04bf5c7caba7d4ae671efdb686c0b331">Lan thought for a moment and nodded. Anyway, she is now Duke of Lachia's fiancee, and you'd better have at least one basic social activity.

</p><p data-p-id="d6ffa206b2f27ba426ddba2f6b2108d6">"Okay, let's open it, but the date is still up."

</p><p data-p-id="c691754c56dadc80b3153dbe75d1c03e">"All right."

</p><p data-p-id="bea5154d7a5a77ca1f0e8d94abbe4852">Kiri greeted lightly and often disappeared. Sina gulped down the hot cake and said.

</p><p data-p-id="01ab1aa44ecccf1f9f5be96fbe663c7e">"Are you having a party?"

</p><p data-p-id="7bf5c65d90eaa961e9e6e24c603dc0fa">"Yes, but the biggest concern is what to do. I don't like hosting on such a large scale."

</p><p data-p-id="e47e7a42ff64931b40a23fe186663763">I like things like this, so I thought it would have been better if I had a strong personality.

</p><p data-p-id="552eba16ca48a9c0d20bdebdb8b64ff9">'I don't hate it. Actually.'

</p><p data-p-id="5c0520d4fc262bcac2855c4db731e9e3">I like to enjoy the party itself. It's just a little hard to plan it.

</p><p data-p-id="a4ae9e4b5a34c705572962d26a02cb52">'But wouldn't it be fun to do it together?'

</p><p data-p-id="983b4e9964d2ff27a9594d852be7672c">Lan grinned at the thought. She asked, looking at Sina.

</p><p data-p-id="129200391cd1fd7a7ce08acc164c53fb">"Sina, do you like parties?" Sina grinned at the words.

</p><p data-p-id="658552fb9ca0ffdfcca4eb01684e8632">"I'm the king of drinking games in this area." Lan laughed without realizing it.

</p><p data-p-id="7128409aedf08a3d7f1b06bb67a8c8aa">"Then shall we ask Sina to do it?"

</p><p data-p-id="ec9e48e2ad7041601d500b65c2e1478c">"What do you mean?"

</p><p data-p-id="5f570b76bb5e8357912d44a8456e816b">"Party planning. I thought it would be fun to do it together." Sina said with her eyes wide open.

</p><p data-p-id="4487626a54d4ec173c689a9ee46d766e">"Really? It's going to be so much fun. Unnie."

</p><p data-p-id="5d69eaa68a38a77cf1779471cfeed737">"Yes, let's do it together." Lan grinned.

</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******

</p><p data-p-id="92649218200404df707aa4a1a4a9f745">Eustaf looked up while looking at the card. Marquis Cyrus said, putting down a pipe cigarette next to him.

</p><p data-p-id="e7faae0e3318adeace62bfda40115c90">"Take it, put 100 more."

</p><p data-p-id="90a77c343839486155dd8779ba12eabf">Colorful chips piled up in front of him. Eustaf also piled up his chips without saying a word.

</p><p data-p-id="5d7b88b6f9faa53e83afe612405f63fc">Other people sitting in the same seat were also wary and one person raised his hand.

</p><p data-p-id="be51b3fd3c9b30ee680393e0b4a25986">"I give up."

</p><p data-p-id="d69a12fa35ec7ee8198897b86131b400">He put down his card.

</p><p data-p-id="226c98b93d8d843c7b0d0cf0f58a33cd">As the number of chips went up, more people gave up, and eventually the Marquis of Cyrus and Eustaf&nbsp; opened the cards. It was from the people sitting at the same table that the admiration burst.

</p><p data-p-id="0bfeb7d1cc93e5f868a1fddd1b7e2bc1">"Full House!"

</p><p data-p-id="e394409369eb67ec3a4ac6acc8d3783d">"Straight flush!"

</p><p data-p-id="7865758fd7999f14d596ea2207108087">"This is worthy of posting."

</p><p data-p-id="ee81d0abec585405c78f73f44e337afe">"Duke Lazia, this is a waste."

</p><p data-p-id="f5d63a166969b0191d6560463ed29cac">Marquis Cyrus laughed and spit out cigarette smoke and pulled his chips. Eustaf grinned and stood up from his seat and said.

</p><p data-p-id="3f450c3ca4f4043b15c6c7c5470367e5">"I lost it, so I'll shake my hand."

</p><p data-p-id="23872687f3001fd70f80b653841fe088">Marquis Cyrus pushed half the chips into the middle of the table.

</p><p data-p-id="af366e8e0150b8b2aadc14d25ead07e8">"I wake up, too. The rest is a good review, so share it."

</p><p data-p-id="e4fc188de8146b016d9f5454e666a027">"As expected, Marquis Cyrus. He's big."

</p><p data-p-id="904331c9c9ca821fcf862eaddd894864">Showing a wave of his hands to those who were flattering, Cyrus followed Eustaf.

</p><p data-p-id="ee8811b86caff8b24787ccdbdd0d9029">A social club full of men was a social venue that showed how talkative men were.

</p><p data-p-id="2786d8d38772915bea3239d9e3760500">At the same time, how weak he is in front of power.

</p>

<p data-p-id="e8e3ea8396a2bd08085dc0753b21ed14">Eustaf said as he moved to the window.

</p><p data-p-id="88b2567434a66d37ae45708df8c215ac">"If you're going to sit down, turn off your cigarette."

</p><p data-p-id="ab6775906d317271fa72352c0c4b9b13">"I didn't know you didn't like it."

</p><p data-p-id="b9a71dca70ae8c099b7fc079718f348e">"Ran hates it."

</p><p data-p-id="ba04265bacc57c77fc347f1db4edbdc7">That means I don't want to smell anything.

</p><p data-p-id="17eacdf8b3b90a9c34c3a6ac340c99ff">Two people rode horses easily at a social club. They met through a relationship between their wives, but now they are quite close.

</p><p data-p-id="33e4761e424952ed73c3d647af97a87a">Marquis Cyrus smiled lightly and wore a pipe cigarette. Instead, he ordered On the Rock from the club butler and asked.

</p><p data-p-id="5588292b07b8b8038e415c1b83cac5ba">"What wind blew you out of here?"

</p><p data-p-id="415f76cb1cf50ee7cc3d2bef4a4828c4">"I'm just thinking about listening."

</p><p data-p-id="390f8780dfc1d94a33c5d9087f201752">Eustaf leaned on the armrest at an angle.

</p><p data-p-id="1535c4cf3c26377f637ee6bd2c13214c">The young, handsome, rich and contrived Duke of Lacia was the object of envy and jealousy in the social club.

</p><p data-p-id="d2ebe091a91b28e31cb21a7a0df3cff4">The butler came up and politely put the glass down next to Marquis Cyrus.

</p><p data-p-id="82f059593de8fdf5443efd58182b4cd6">At that moment, the approaching man pushed the butler roughly, and the butler stumbled and missed the glass.

</p><p data-p-id="dbf6a3de1c2cdaa24a661b110d9eb79c">Crank!

</p><p data-p-id="0bb97edbd72570a9f4e4ec02a2bb7327">Everyone's eyes were on this side with the loud sound of the glass breaking.

</p><p data-p-id="d63ddc3ab24e2dfcf3606fd3a0b00946">Marquis Cyrus frowned at his opponent, and Eustaf looked up at his opponent with a blank look.

</p><p data-p-id="e1ad3988b9801b7f76cae019d7ff0aef">"Marquis, will you step aside?"

</p><p data-p-id="6a9f6227a203928c632535f10c8ad98c">"Do you think I want to do that now?"

</p><p data-p-id="3052232bec4993f033e3606c769e235b">Marquis Cyrus kicked his tongue at the broken glass. Then the opponent took the sword and everyone swallowed their breath. He pointed the blade at Eustaf.

</p><p data-p-id="0e8d030ca06ee549582147cdf8482675">I saw the blade of the blade that Eustaf put on his opponent.

</p><p data-p-id="054d0c313448f9c591cba8526fb44509">"Name?"

</p><p data-p-id="ab0e8d1dac0f672b88c39c869ce35916">Then the young man, who was busy, said low.

</p><p data-p-id="8c4b5a1d830cd67cf89405aabb9bf697">"The Marquis of Cameron."

</p><p data-p-id="c1748442c9c7e28bd17d7eed168b22f7">"Ah."

</p><p data-p-id="3b8684df054f2586e1dd3058229a2954">In a short way, when Eustaf pushed the blade to the tip of his hand, Marquis Cameron gave strength to the hand that held the knife.

</p><p data-p-id="f720fc0ef4d6b8a5529cb91eab26aec0">"Mar, Marquis. You can't do this here."

</p><p data-p-id="183e65841071fbe73ffb1006a50a98d4">The embarrassed club butler began to stop the Marquis Cameron.

</p><p data-p-id="e81e3e875128c6f1cc2eea2c100c81bf">"Noisy—my parents' enemies are in front of me!" Eustaf blinked.

</p><p data-p-id="a94aeba71682286d058e553d8af3e292">"Have I ever killed Marquis Cameron?"

</p><p data-p-id="6bd946d8f158d81556d3b79d4af05a1c">"Since you killed my brother, you have started to suffer! It's like you killed him!"

</p><p data-p-id="edee0a35c89cb1458ff6d966032df8e3">"You mean the man who broke into my estate?"

</p><p data-p-id="a5bc36fde9d6129485b4546c469eb107">What was his name? When he saw him gawking, the Marquis kicked his tongue inside.

</p><p data-p-id="9226bc204fa54f179b0cfab8e1682863">'He's capable of provocation.'

</p><p data-p-id="67cf732aecef0d5f989dfd056b9972b1">"You bastard!"

</p><p data-p-id="fdb0f1486f5853f8a32339dbdad7f61d">'And then the idiot falls for the provocation.'

</p><p data-p-id="32ef7e90b81e1527b568cc3dbd311b25">As Marquis Cameron raised the sword, Eustaf rose from his seat and broke his wrist.

</p><p data-p-id="8c23d966d1d174667e8c7d4358a61a03">"Argh!"

</p><p data-p-id="0d7862b22396342bcce4d2b9d95d4b1a">With a scream, he grabbed the fallen sword with his opposite hand and Eustaf lightly put it on the Marquis' neck.

</p><p data-p-id="a9669721458caafcc579b78a7e84ba29">"Hak!"

</p><p data-p-id="a7396c5e5b0a930a0413be329f424315">Without realizing it, the Marquis of Cameron shivered. Eustaf thought about it for a while and then let him go and put the sword on the floor.

</p><p data-p-id="f48153606e19924fe0f0cb971462d589">"I'll take the black road."

</p><p data-p-id="f4a7df95a9f96ef48d1fae54e0d9c9ea">Then he flopped back into place and told the butler.

</p><p data-p-id="e1135e0fe72ef5007036ce7f020fb7d7">"Get a new cup for Marquis."

</p><p data-p-id="62c1246d31fa437272a0a1c951cb1ac9">The Marquis of Cameron shook his body with a broken face and left without taking his sword. Marquis Cyrus kicked his tongue.

</p><p data-p-id="8bb5c4e5d7638693582618aa61a4df14">"You have a talent for making enemies."

</p><p data-p-id="a0e28f44dd564b46e38dbd377ced1895">"Rare talent." <br>Eustaf said so and sighed.

</p><p data-p-id="eac9a2dba9d600fd9d51acbb3df54429">"You've met some kind of jerk."

</p><p data-p-id="68c6e5f8ec807579a4ba3f23d9cd7535">"What are you here to hear?"

</p><p data-p-id="ef43e08ffb77e4b9ffbf795983d6cbc9">Marquis Cyrus smiled at the butler who brought him a new glass and said,

</p><p data-p-id="a39771745ef19b7b294f965c282653b2">"I'm sorry for the disturbance,"<br>before he saw him.

</p><p data-p-id="28648f57bee7f1573974972db4221735">Eustaf thought for a moment and said,

</p><p data-p-id="c461acd07ced4d4548e712fee062f4e4">"No. Nothing."

</p><p data-p-id="30183462c0d2193d203b6de8e636526e">Eustaf stood up from his seat and said,

</p><p data-p-id="864845320658d731f96ae2c6a1385fdb">"I shouldn't have said that."

</p><p data-p-id="c036a6b0fabad031629cb883528560dd">Marquis Cyrus circled his glass. The amber liquid danced lightly on the ice.

</p><p data-p-id="1d2b29e2e3282e1ffadb5c91eb90eba1">"Rumor has it that Lan was the mistress of the former Emperor?"

</p><p data-p-id="0ebecee0cf837ea7702041fc024053ac">At the moment, I felt like I saw Yustaf's blue eyes on fire, so Marquis Cyrus pointed to him, saying,

</p><p data-p-id="3ff9f8e266627161400a3d68b7d128f6">'I stabbed you for no reason.'

</p><p data-p-id="af2e4cce1cc61170fdeeb88057d40c4a">"Sit down, right?"
