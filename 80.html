<p><b><u>LUMIERE CONFESS</u></b>
<p>Ran burst into laughter as if he were talking about it.</p>

<p>"Of course, I know."</p>

<p>"No, it's not that, it's that I want to kiss and embrace."</p>

<p>Ran's eyes opened wide at his words and soon her face turned red.</p>

<p>"Huh? What? Really?"</p>

<p>Ran coughed in vain as her voice shook wildly. Lumiere burst into laughter when he saw her like that. I think it's the first time I've embarrassed Ran and made her shake.</p>

<p>I was glad about it.</p>

<p>"What…what… were you kidding?"</p>

<p>Lumiere shook his head as Ran stuttered.</p>

<p>"No, I mean it. But I've already been dumped."</p>

<p>Only then did Ran recall the conversation she had with Lumiere before.</p>

<p>'That was me!'</p>

<p>Ran was embarrassed.</p>

<p>"…."</p>

<p>Not knowing what to do, Ran took a deep breath and said,</p>

<p>"Thank you for liking me. But I already have someone I like. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Lumiere smiled at the sincere rejection. She takes confession of someone like her seriously. That's why I started liking it.</p>

<p>"No, thank you for telling me."</p>

<p>"Me too, thank you for telling me."</p>

<p>I can't imagine how difficult it will be to confess.
<p>And Ran spokes.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I told Lumiere to quit escorting me in advance. Otherwise, you would have thought it was for another reason."</p>

<p>"That's true."</p>

<p>Lumiere nodded lightly.</p>

<p>Arriving at the green arch, the carriage door opened, Eustaf stood instead of his servant.</p>

<p>"What's going on?"</p>

<p>Ran smiled and got out of the carriage holding the hand that Eustaf put out.</p>

<p>"I came to meet my lover who came home from a busy job."</p>

<p>Eustaf said so and looked at Lumiere. Lumiere smiled with a different face than usual, and Eustaf's expression became strange. Without noticing the atmosphere between the two, Ran laughed and said to his answer.</p>

<p>"I wasn't that busy. By the way…Eustaf."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Olivia invited me."</p>

<p>Eustaf's eyes looked at Ran and looked straight back.</p>

<p>"Are you going?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know yet. ····."</p>

<p>"I hope you don't go."</p>

<p>"Really? Then tell her I'm sick and then I’ll stay home-"</p>

<p>"Can you do that?"</p>

<p>There was a hint of joy in his voice. These days, Ran wasn't in the whole house because she was working in the social world, and the two of them had less time to have privacy together.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Should I?"</p>

<p>Entering the mansion, there was a faint scent of flowers. More suitors were rushing in now than when she was Duke, and the flowers were piled up to the point where there was no room to step on.</p>

<p>Of course, not to mention letters. When Eustaf asked her for the letter, Ran freaked out and said, "That's not it." She handled the letter.</p>

<p>However, there was nothing he could do about it, so Eustaf donated the entire flowers to nursing homes and orphanages.</p>

<p>"Should I at least ask for a duel to calm herself down?"</p>

<p>Eustaf murmured in a faint voice, and Ran answered,</p>

<p>"Maybe it's more of a hot topic." I'm so scared of social outcasts.</p>

<p>Ran groaned at her words.</p>

<p>Ran was staying at the 'Green Arch' as a guest. She was Eustaf's lover, but at the same time, it was not so strange for her to stay in the Patriarch House.</p>

<p>Patriarch-Disciple, it's very common in this relationship. However, if they were just lovers, staying in the house was worth the sound.</p>

<p>Therefore, Ran once seriously considered buying a mansion, but the managers said that Eustaf's dissuasion and that the sale of the mansion, which he thought was strangely okay, had
<p>disappeared.</p>

<p>'It's obvious who did it, but ·····.'</p>

<p>At the same time as the thought of doing so, it was certainly troublesome to move out, so with the words, "I can't help it," Ran was a thrill.</p>

<p>When Lumiere greeted and stepped down in the middle hallway, Eustaf asked.</p>

<p>"What did you talk about with him?"</p>

<p>"We've talked a little bit some things."</p>

<p>Ran was wondering how far she should go, but said she had decided to leave the escort for now.</p>

<p>"Because I feel like he's taking up too much training time."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>After answering, Eustaf was silent and couldn't help but ask.</p>

<p>"But did he say it was okay?"</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"The knight."</p>

<p>"Uh- we had a little conversation, and I convinced Lumiere."</p>

<p>Ran grinned.</p>

<p>"And there aren't many places in the community to take escorts, are there? Most people walk around with their maid."</p>

<p>"That's true."</p>

<p>Eustaf said after a moment of thought.</p>

<p>"I'll attach a new maid."</p>

<p>"with the ability?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>After answering, Eustaf looked around and saw that no one was around, and pulled her waist and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Umm-"</p>

<p>When Ran groaned quietly, Eustaf's arm with her back in his arms became more difficult.</p>

<p>His tongue came in with his slightly open lips. Ran flinched and swallowed her breath. The sensation that the bumps, slowly rubbing her tongue, seemed to be caressed one by one gave her
<p>goose bumps.</p>

<p>Even though it was a short, exploratory kiss, her legs trembled.</p>

<p>She barely protested.</p>

<p>"If-If you do this in the hallway-"</p>

<p>"I can't kiss you like this in the room."</p>

<p>Isn't it more dangerous to do it in an enclosed space?</p>

<p>At Eustaf's words, Ran rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>'Is that how it works?'</p>

<p>Eustaf opened the door for her.</p>

<p>"Welcome."</p>

<p>"Oh my, did you come with Lord?"</p>

<p>The cheerful voices of Kiri and Dimodia brightened Ran's face.
