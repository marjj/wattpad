<p data-p-id="d3c49ef35c75217d0225b43739052388">There was nothing he could do there anyway.


</p><p data-p-id="26f0fc399cb40f9bcbeeb20b5f961ceb">It seemed that he would resent Eustaf if he stayed any longer.


</p><p data-p-id="30fd2044dba721c67f16d21aa152c1fb">Because you caught Lan, she had a plan to leave here and live her life.


</p><p data-p-id="14c1599147e480ce5ef15b97dd067373">It's all because of you.


</p><p data-p-id="648eba236d64257d0fe5d504c6d5d52c">That's not Eustaf's fault. I know it myself.


</p><p data-p-id="10263bd067a5bfaf73477cdedefc7fe1">However, Lumiere left there because he thought it would explode endlessly.


</p><p data-p-id="8f3cbb0c7c0d502ce51c706019e59fbf">It was Sina's room that he visited. I was told that she was a guest, so she was taken to the guest room, but after that, she was left unattended.


</p><p data-p-id="0ca12ea3331eccdc313e84be74f664a0">Sina jumped out of her seat when she saw Lumiere in.


</p><p data-p-id="cc2c91960b68092cf16228facf19ae6f">"There 路路路路."


</p><p data-p-id="71ef7e7e2668191180cd8747af77e7c0">Sina asked hesitantly.


</p><p data-p-id="da9510d1ac80592df5f6cc8232f92c6b">"Is she all right earlier?"


</p><p data-p-id="8c6aa11ee228662b94385d3d42cf83aa">"No"


</p><p data-p-id="83adc9a89998b90804615d40c2839acd">Lumiere answered briefly, and Sina stretched her shoulders.


</p><p data-p-id="6e4d571d6b69168455a680af8d6e53d6">"That's too bad."


</p><p data-p-id="bb1e108871934bde351aa3e71d10893a">Sina recalled a great blonde beauty. I only saw her at a glance because of the urgency of the situation, but she was a person who could see that she was quite a beauty.


</p><p data-p-id="e1aeac5bbf60ec6fa2c17a0371a8cd3e">Sina continued to ask.


</p><p data-p-id="36e239558a65710b1d1e1fae16bd03f0">"Are you okay?"


</p><p data-p-id="e01a7bb0377e2c8741da8e14ffc713d4">Lumiere looked at the words as if they had broken into Sina. There was some sympathy in the black eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="8b8333188f007d86f35bf8caf9402af5">She was a perfect stranger and had an advantage over him and Lan.


</p><p data-p-id="84317638857479a21bfba4a1ae37ff01">And it was easy for a person, rather, to tell the stranger how he felt.


</p><p data-p-id="e97161ce7842d2058991ca5633022bf2">"No"


</p><p data-p-id="f5b69b3480aac6042618fd0fab4093d8">Lumiere said that and smirked.


</p><p data-p-id="4eca9560033653b96d377087911905e7">"Not a little bit."


</p><p data-p-id="494456fa5cc1ab34aebe1894b4d12b02">He clenched his teeth.


</p><p data-p-id="8d962e9e96acdee69bf31f1f53d2d101">"Not a little, not a little-"


</p><p data-p-id="b6a64325f5add703591d819584e4a5c4">Sina gave him an awkward pat on the waist.


</p><p data-p-id="0db48fbac44d710410283b248cb489e1">"You'll be all right."


</p><p data-p-id="ff8eea7467c0a1872f1439e9755a18a6">I didn't know if it was going to be okay with Lan, or he was going to be okay, or both, but Lumiere felt comfort.


</p><p data-p-id="1c959057b36837fa2b9ee437ce4c1382">In the past, he would have called it such nonsense.


</p><p data-p-id="fa7f60f1293e93f8133efba55e1b4ee3">'But I hope so, too.'


</p><p data-p-id="5fb7f64aab71d3605dd72554c254356d">Hope Lan's okay.


</p><p data-p-id="e2a362e2f1a2aaf1fa287f02b128400c">Because I'm desperate for that.


</p><p data-p-id="c3b80a3f6039f8bdf458396d085c5488">Lumiere breathed out a long breath and said.


</p><p data-p-id="bd3c2fe1b35b304ba1a12f373c8b9f65">"My master asked me to save you, so I'll take care of you until she gets back."


</p><p data-p-id="276fc9d2fea22c4a4e15dcc62bc75379">At the words, Sina quickly lowered her back and asked.


</p><p data-p-id="3c5332f7e733dd8dc8f689783bd9e279">"You?"


</p><p data-p-id="f57fff013ce31dfdf09e512595df515e">"Yeah. So why were you there?"


</p><p data-p-id="986b6a5cfb2cf11b37046c2072b00982">Sina frowned on her nose.


</p><p data-p-id="5ec35e1b18f06530b4a6bcf139695ab7">"I don't know either."


</p><p data-p-id="b4996af59ffca25738954775e4ddba04">"Tell me anything."


</p><p data-p-id="dfe08f46606271652dd442d4e3d019f0">Lumiere said so, and Sina breathed a breath.


</p><p data-p-id="e180528a4c8650e023a5122469f9bd22">"I don't know if you believe-"


</p><p data-p-id="b069d09ec0b2540f5acfaba21cbad711">She started a fairly long story.


</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******


</p><p data-p-id="08004d73cb826d2efdc0421ef1d48447">Lan stared at the black darkness.


</p><p data-p-id="07ba76c773d4318c663c5d54fbb4722e">'Bug, bad boy.'


</p><p data-p-id="92c41ea1f3a00c3cf98b2758dd775bff">No matter how hard it is, why are you taking my eyes because you saved my life?


</p><p data-p-id="0b9125e9086f9c8a7b97d83fe363f527">The pain in the shoulder was almost gone now. It was great to have a world record history.


</p>

<p data-p-id="43077f249d2e3c727d47883c1c15c8e4">I was still wearing a bandage, but it didn't hurt. <br>Lan breathed a sigh of relief because she only suffered bruises here and there and there were no fractures.


</p><p data-p-id="1bc0dc5008de43861f13eedb3ea24fc8">'But I can't see anything you can see.'


</p><p data-p-id="7c054457e11576c87287ce7b47e68447">Lan groaned and her eyes were swollen.


</p><p data-p-id="efd822edecef13af8f156700e25d8e42">The therapist said, "You may be able to see," in case there was a problem with your head, but Lan knew best that it would not be visible.


</p><p data-p-id="3013cd447faa73158ab83e3f143fc2c0">Still, I wanted to cling to the healer's words.


</p><p data-p-id="bec86a3c2348a81336891db4f223f4e3">'No, they say that having false hopes is the biggest torture.' It would be better to give up and try to adjust.


</p><p data-p-id="65d349e9baa39487d0da5c9a0d707146">'It's not like I'm dying because I can'


</p><p data-p-id="548f05f0b4fb0a2fe59f75dc241c0159">Lan thought so and took a deep breath.


</p><p data-p-id="7d7232a2c0709e4e1b381545742c81cc">'For the rest of my life, like this....'


</p><p data-p-id="f245c3cbcb53ab92580586dfd52b051c">Lan buried her face tightly on the pillow.


</p><p data-p-id="595de105cab53ec5382002c85bb0809b">'I can't live like this!' It was so unfair.


</p><p data-p-id="010989e8abbe06b4f95e02fc40e574a7">I never wanted to be possessed like this. Had been suffering from here to death three disappeared in the world of this because I don't think you need me to, now. Is it this?


</p><p data-p-id="a642a97e2b3ec9cbf7124a725b40e74b">'Or is it a coincidence that I'm taking too much leap forward?'


</p><p data-p-id="c205f7c48b417d43cb22475f9e5cae9c">Lan held her head, went public, and sighed again.


</p><p data-p-id="cc4101d308632fc75c22baed14584f02">'The Masu....'


</p><p data-p-id="b86279549f25db048d0e19936057fd4a">He said 'no' before he threw her away.


</p><p data-p-id="990be0e387454464330aad5bf161363a">"No........ It's not."


</p><p data-p-id="c9d1a45037560b738d5bd7d691612900">When I think about what Eustaf said before, I think he's looking for someone, but it was obvious who is was.


</p><p data-p-id="c257532759fba04bf742fa0374ec7cce">'The Great Sage, Iveria.'


</p><p data-p-id="6a43045f837e80f3bc8260ad4c07ef34">He's looking for someone who sealed him.


</p><p data-p-id="fdc51a9098a5f863fdc44b3adda6e041">'It's been a thousand years.'


</p><p data-p-id="413ab49b01e112958243fbc359abc461">Lan groaned softly. She raised her upper body in bed and stretched her arms out to grope. <br>After checking the end of the bed, Lan came down from the bed and stood there.


</p><p data-p-id="88936499c445db1d71c6bf48c8e5bc2f">"Are you awake?"


</p><p data-p-id="420a1739c99952302bb3188b45e0ac7d">With a soft voice, Lan turned her head to the sound.


</p><p data-p-id="d590d6c017c83ffa34c1762a08b25731">"Yes. How many days have I been in bed?"


</p><p data-p-id="41f4596fd3d9f472d7fcb6535f4da650">"Four days."


</p><p data-p-id="8f58534055a84fe4815eea64375e401d">Kara's voice was soft, and Lan's voice comforted her a little. Lan came up and held her hand back by shaking it.


</p><p data-p-id="3a90994fd3a80f1eeb8213bd0983ddf5">"No, I want to go around alone."


</p><p data-p-id="54d6a9893fa277ae0828278f0474015d">"But-"


</p><p data-p-id="b79b6e0d9c994b77d938d00feafbb627">"I'm not leaving the bedroom. Everyone, get out of here."


</p><p data-p-id="912d975e967341d63ed62102ca9b0c30">There was silence at the words, and there was a heavy saying, "All right," and the bedroom door opened and closed.


</p><p data-p-id="03f7af8baaf5e174db22e1f0c78c21d0">Lan took a deep breath and began to walk, groping in the air. <br>Walking in sight was much scarier than I thought.


</p><p data-p-id="f9c1fc57485a50a12295f5dbeb7430e3">'I know why you need a cane.'


</p><p data-p-id="2bd01137065714b0040690a8b5964d08">Lan thought so and slowly explored the area with her arms and legs. She couldn't move a step or two and stopped several times. <br>It was rather nice to have furniture on my hands. It's scarier to feel in the air without anything. <br>Lan moved to the wall.


</p><p data-p-id="e9beabef967ba95fe227f89adb2907b0">Feeling relieved when her fingertips touched the wall, she put her fingertips on the wall and started walking around the room loudly. <br>I could feel the soft lug under my bare feet, and there was no big problem, although furniture and tapestries were caught.


</p><p data-p-id="208899348229320a89e052099a2098cb">'But what do I do from now on?' Lan stopped with that thought.


</p><p data-p-id="ae641187b7d58d4be7eae43875c2dbd7">Sina is here. She became blind. <br>I told Youth to get engaged in spring, but I'm glad you put it off like that, too.


</p>

<p data-p-id="677eef624eb7e6d0c63a602bb1330cb1">It would be hard for anyone to get engaged to a blind person. <br>Tears welled up again. <br>I've been crying and crying in bed for four days, but I'm still crying. <br>Lan didn't even wipe her tears, but started walking again. Since you can't see it anyway, whether you cry or not, your vision will never be narrowed.


</p><p data-p-id="ec85ad21e97ba6eac758ab77f30c1188">I don't even know how long it took to go around the room. There was a window in the middle, so I tried opening and closing the window. <br>When I managed to get back to bed, I was completely exhausted and Lan fell asleep as if she were falling.


</p><p data-p-id="445023d16089c01d43718b78f4bdc7c4">******


</p><p data-p-id="f61a424c172d4f889ef11b9fee578492">Dreams are clear. <br>Lan looked at the white space, bit her lips, and soon opened her mouth when she saw a leopard appearing through the space. <br>At first, it was the leopard spirit that she saw when she met the spirit. <br>I thought it might be a top-class spirit.


</p><p data-p-id="2dc09c6bdf8e37a31aef824bd32f117e">"Phanias." <br>Lan gently called him.


</p><p data-p-id="d784ad7a3d7c94a152336eceeccacc73">Leopard head, human upper body, six wings, and the leopard's lower body. <br>And he still had leopard hair, but he had a friendly face. <br>Lan cried again, biting her lips tightly and rubbing her eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="9533eaf3ec43bd36440d2f1252a2a26b">"Hello"


</p><p data-p-id="ed9d4cb73cfbc6a8b4a65996a12acfb5">When she barely said hello, the leopard smiled softly.


</p><p data-p-id="c13f537810c7be093f5464ecb0829ecc">"I heard from Istarif."


</p><p data-p-id="2dee1a5f3e8aefe7479812b42159a5f6">Lan looked up quickly.


</p><p data-p-id="dd779fa9574dd741c7d6ee150fc8c52d">"From Istarif?"


</p><p data-p-id="b9f2e7fa09e66406366ffdeaec5d811e">"Yes, and from Candral."


</p><p data-p-id="8f93ba89631615a527b8112bac5d59c4">Lan flinched at the name. The spirit smiled faintly when he saw anger on her face.


</p><p data-p-id="6ff9fe64d421fa65c40a53e1b60cd48d">"The spirits that serve humans have strong self-esteem."


</p><p data-p-id="5af071b7535ddce6531f2aa512b9126a">The leopard shook his hand, creating a fluffy chair and table made of cloud as before. <br>Lan sat quietly in the chair. The feeling of covering her body was good.


</p><p data-p-id="52b601a96b8d58d7b34e1b25c4de8b57">The leopard sat with his four legs boiling in front of the table, but his eyes were still much higher than Lan.


</p><p data-p-id="dcc87928a95b7b03a462e984a8ce6767">"Because I have to obey humans, I hate listening to human commands the most."


</p><p data-p-id="7498f7c8757a10b4abd0b05e27f905c3">When the leopard said so and breathed long, a gleaming mist wrapped her face. <br>The breath of the Spirit smelled like spring.


</p><p data-p-id="b54eb2637debe0b12ef61cff05e94f0e">"I talked to Kandral. You'll be up in about a week."


</p><p data-p-id="53402ad348f3c23cb3113f37c7a8d4e8">"Really?"


</p><p data-p-id="3133a458738cd71cf89675ff5f3bc06e">Lan jumped from her seat without realizing it, and the leopard nodded.<br><br>"Because I don't want a rare man to hold grudges against the spirits like in a long time. Besides, Shal likes you."


</p><p data-p-id="874fd2c00bcd0d9970b6e5dd430f78e5">Only then did Lan think of "Shall." It might have been better to call her.


</p><p data-p-id="a65b3fa062a34edac931411aa9dc72b4">"Thank you. Thank you very much!"


</p><p data-p-id="68a51a5650dcc5bc34fe0c6421bdc241">Lan greeted him several times, and the leopard blinked and said, like It's funny.


</p><p data-p-id="f16f2956433320a4dfe84bf0e6ee5397">"Then do you even know my name?"


</p><p data-p-id="54a76ba4c9417bafff1d85e1dc70bb4c">Lan opened her mouth slightly at the words. The leopard made an interesting look at her eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="3073dd57955264b5297a5659246f8a7d">"Do you know that?"


</p><p data-p-id="2d870ce8229530efc57689ba491572c1">"No, I don't know. I know a few more names, but I don't know if they fit....."


</p><p data-p-id="efaeb574b3efc1a6de8834fcffc1a951">The leopard flicked his mottled tail and said,


</p><p data-p-id="c01bebdc0d70bfd72cfb2a37758af7af">"You'd better be alert for this. About the price of calling the Spirit's name and exerting his power." Lan exhaled deeply.


</p><p data-p-id="41612563e6ef388ac40975a5865411fc">"I've already been fully alerted."


</p><p data-p-id="85d029d1a67be050b1f40e6d76cda249">Lan said with a tired face. I will never ask the Spirit to do it again.


</p><p data-p-id="1dc040d120ef5acd13acab51d60476fb">'No, I couldn't do that, but'


</p>

<p data-p-id="f0d9b2f3bdbb91ef14a9966d875cfdeb">If it weren't for him, she'd be dead. <br>Now that I think about it, I think it's better not to see than to die. <br>How can a human being be so shallow? <br>Lan told her, feeling sick and tired of herself.


</p><p data-p-id="959b630f61ed3d8292bd0e8d7eaed2d9">"Now I won't call the name of the Spirit recklessly. Never. But Istar, no, blue flame talked about it?"


</p><p data-p-id="34b6163403eee3866e07bd41b25687ed">"Yes, Istarif likes humans. She enjoy playing around."


</p><p data-p-id="308a144a86299ab65bb708cf85d29ba1">The leopard pointed his head, and only then did I remember that he was surprised by Blue flame always cracking his head.


</p><p data-p-id="e40b6cfb756d872149c2c47fc7299054">"I, I see."


</p><p data-p-id="744fa36e6b86b927ccd1e6bf3a7081e2">But goodwill is better than evil.


</p><p data-p-id="e42b5484117c0b9a86c2289ba174e0ef">"And I'm sorry that I couldn't make it when you called me. But even a spirit can't appear in two places at the same time."


</p><p data-p-id="124f3cc23dda2fa1b061dc27e1033637">"Ah-!" <br>Lan made a small noise.


</p><p data-p-id="51065c4139dfeed6c2019267b6a936d8">You didn't come even if I called you because Eustaf was using it. <br>It was said to be in the process of sealing the door was sealed. <br>Lan's shoulders drooped.


</p><p data-p-id="49172a39807eef258ab3c72ece15c1ba">"I see. So she asked him, did she ask you?"


</p><p data-p-id="6c58d3e9601255e133f5d55ed877db0a">"Yes, I want you to mediate with Kandral."


</p><p data-p-id="20ca5e9263fc22933dbd1ad2a4b41f16">"That's very kind of you."


</p><p data-p-id="2391e93dd2c5df3e3a3544fb01fb75f6">Thanks to this, Lan was willing to give Blue flame at least three cheers.


</p><p data-p-id="4c036106f495ffc25d1dd21cdb546686">"And the darkness is waking up?"


</p><p data-p-id="6f9e41205f4c10b02ef6fa7c510f7b81">Lan nodded wildly at the leopard's question.


</p><p data-p-id="941f459bb2b35bad46beb66a23790975">"That's right! So now, I think I'm looking for Iveria. Someone who disappeared a thousand years ago." She sighed deeply.


</p><p data-p-id="dd32ab4c58989a94cd960c3aa1ea78bc">It was because of the darkness of the door, DelPanto, that Sina came here. <br>While searching for Iveria, she happened to find a different space, and she came here because she thought she was Iveria with long black hair.


</p><p data-p-id="74005ba7b393d1748911146d196117ef">'Oh, that's why you sent him to the police.' To catch Sina.


</p><p data-p-id="4c818e1477f424999dc3948e419f38a5">'Even though I've been caught off guard' Lan sighed.


</p><p data-p-id="11ed5612bb00d310dd8f0122a1efc440">"Did the Spirit hear anything? How to seal it again路路路路路路路路?"


</p><p data-p-id="751e7b9101dfc2ab545c00ee4e9a84cc">Not knowing what to call the leopard, Lan called him by the appropriate name. The leopard blinked its golden eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="4d71787f2e5003d9bab815dd28ca1e1a">"That's not something I can tell you."


</p><p data-p-id="05fb057deb2428903c9f150fba6592da">Lan jumped up from her seat, pointing at the table.


</p><p data-p-id="3958ef544de182c360e981e43ec72a10">"You know something, right?"


</p><p data-p-id="538a69074a065d5ca9a9857fb1f8917b">"There's something you want, and if I want to give it to you, you have to pay for it."


</p><p data-p-id="04ddafacc892fbb7d518d50fb2cf810d">Lan bit her lips slightly. <br>"What price?"


</p><p data-p-id="78c20041f7a8d1da3b53516650340339">"You won't be able to pay it, and I won't say."


</p><p data-p-id="0f53c417c72cf140c2140ed6c963c6d3">After saying so, the leopard got up from his seat with his legs straightened. <br>Lan raised her hand.


</p><p data-p-id="df813aa677af675c3c85a48888922f8f">"So, I read that this story ends well. So wouldn't it end well?"


</p><p data-p-id="d6da840fc9e320a9e4e6647d289d4492">Words flowed from her as if she were being confirmed without realizing it. The leopard looked at Lan for a moment and said softly.


</p><p data-p-id="4b98672481b79387a41dcbcf32062ff3">"Too much has changed already. Nothing is right with what you heard. Right?"


</p><p data-p-id="c0911634ea70570f91689a5dfda64d2b">Lan nodded at the leopard's question again.


</p><p data-p-id="1d9da6fcb67afc3c2c38bf458239fc97">"Then it's like we're in a world of uncertainty."


</p><p data-p-id="e32189f0c2a3d24670959c683a91c965">Lan's face turned pale. Which means we might lose.


</p><p data-p-id="3462f0edb2bd65e01af582b73189a6e1">'Eustaf may die.....'


</p><p data-p-id="7afb83289dde616c330152a2dfec809e">"If, if we do anything to get the flow right now-" The leopard shook his head and said.


</p><p data-p-id="d5d87c9d1eaeb78d3fd94baf05a3f7e1">"We can't turn what's already wrong. Go back."


</p><p data-p-id="17ad373819f970c0249f923268fcfe96">"Wait a minute. If you're going to wake me up, can't you just gently wake me up?"


</p><p data-p-id="6ee100f81c7c5a2b0a96b6da52ae5c65">The leopard laughed, and Lan felt her feet go out.


</p><p data-p-id="d4a54bbb607f66b33428875c5b25edc9">"Hukk!"


</p><p data-p-id="0f06ac1474db903575e24fe354116c40">Lan struggled and opened her eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="503255e5137ab37d8415261fec0ae37b">'Oh, come on.'


</p><p data-p-id="aaffab501a1c0f5f5af1489b119dc5b8">She sighed. The story I shared with the leopard still lingered in my head.


</p><p data-p-id="8f5492164afae4804990704973919287">'No, you don't know yet.'


</p><p data-p-id="a0b9dd09f55963a244419ff2057ff227">Yustaf could get better with Sina, right? Then,thenCan't we just go with the flow? <br>But that would be painful. <br>In contradictory emotions, Lan rubbed her eyes while she was in public. It's still dark before my eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="fa35ef5554574b69d9b7679ffd7d4e38">'But I'm going to open my eyes a week later.'


</p><p data-p-id="739b22158cb999539c7203779b77400a">Lan raised her upper body thinking so. I stammered out of bed and could not hear anything. <br>It's quiet to listen.


</p><p data-p-id="25ee06e8cac74617222b7e8a39979077">'Is it night?'


</p><p data-p-id="45ad83743202a054efb969cb3d0f972c">Maybe it's time for everyone to sleep.


</p><p data-p-id="03d14535dd5c137cdbefe7757cc97d67">'I want to drink water.'


</p><p data-p-id="1109ded82c6e8519fb5214fba116b5df">Lan fumbled for a cup of water thinking so. <br>After a long time, she could find a bottle of water and a cup of water on the bed table. The cup was already filled, so she slowly checked the taste and drank water when she checked that what was inside was water. <br>As I put down the glass, I felt strangely eye-catching.


</p><p data-p-id="1cf22fb23d7e7a70bae36bf12bfe92d8">Lan looked around. <br>"Is anyone there?"


</p><p data-p-id="b7c136a3d1f3366e482c6a510b1fdf44">But if she had a maid, she would have seen herself drinking water and come to help her right away.


</p><p data-p-id="fde3241b6313201e3663f61ad2a55cc8">'What is it?'


</p><p data-p-id="58507dd5d3954bb72940c4dd55f31dae">Gutting, Lan opened her mouth. <br>"Eustaf?"


</p><p data-p-id="1a2935d98dd9ed0b1cd96cfd5d38a1b8">******


</p><p data-p-id="b844a09db9357be33956dca82a558e28">Eustaf, who was sitting on the sofa, seemed to have a thumping heart as soon as she called his name.


</p><p data-p-id="53f30e3a42279513fa85e23b325b08f5">But there was no answer. <br>Sitting in silence, Lan looked up and came out of bed. <br>Slowly, Lan reached into the air and began to stutter forward.


</p><p data-p-id="71c00287ad750812f8aa62630c1ad6e2">Eustaf should talk to her now, and she won't be surprised, or what she thinks of himself in her room this late at night.


</p><p data-p-id="45230714e904397f98bba0cd0bc38557">I looked at Lan with that thought. <br>The maids were alternately taking care of Lan all night, and today Eustaf came to watch Lan, telling them to rest.
