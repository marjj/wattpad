<p data-p-id="96d3453c0b1e99e5500725256a2e5415">"It's hot.....stuffy....."

</p><p data-p-id="ea5cbb6246175081fbde370a32c3494b">Lan opened her eyes while talking in public. Sweat flows through herforehead.

</p><p data-p-id="6ed70aa71bada15fc122ec4420ae4cf5">Something's tied up.

</p><p data-p-id="a79ad9847b9a8780cabf43c3c66233f5">It was only after a decade or so that I could grasp the situation properly.

</p><p data-p-id="cbd2f9bb0b0d4270f1c861ea19ecf7ff">'Eustaf?!'

</p><p data-p-id="c8cc5fbfbedce041ff897aed75287ae4">She is hugged by Eustaf. That's why it's hot. Because you're hugging me tightly with your arms.

</p><p data-p-id="15d1ea69256b444b27eebd556891575c">The logic circuit in my head went hard. Then the alarm went off.

</p><p data-p-id="2da36c555cb7cf49a3663f8dec4b225f">'Me, clothes?'

</p><p data-p-id="ebaddd45f7bfc3e105108f8a7080b0c0">Nothing!

</p><p data-p-id="23c1520449f3ca8020d6b1ea3197394b">Where's the dress?!

</p><p data-p-id="6dd09064efef8cc0be77be8afd8a2752">Chemise? Is it just Chemise?

</p><p data-p-id="f8cdfdb3371fcd44630914c926765973">Wait, it's an engagement? isn't Is one bed okay for the engagement?

</p><p data-p-id="9d4dae2a238f3e4f452234a960f61b09">I don't even remember. Huh? What is it?

</p><p data-p-id="8aa29aeae2ab51aa13ff3043cb8b226c">What happened last night?

</p><p data-p-id="cafa01fbd7d3cfabbcd1aaf9142e39f1">"Pum...."

</p><p data-p-id="663406cdaff6351ef98aee8ce64fd937">Then there was a small sound above her head, so Lan heard a terrible red face. When her eyes met, Eustaf burst into laughter.

</p><p data-p-id="b172f33ff3d030cb064522866d81a253">"Hahahaha!"

</p><p data-p-id="2fa9e5f865d003b126ab84704c7843b5">Lan opened her mouth wide. I've never seen Youth smile like this before.

</p><p data-p-id="7ca3b4ae0a5a98d723b4c9413c68302a">As I stared blankly at him, Eustaf barely stopped laughing and tapped her nose lightly with his fingers.

</p><p data-p-id="825ec5e8273957fae65eecc37b825747">"Did you realize that I was a man?"

</p><p data-p-id="a8ab6bfcae9b307c98e31c3b8999ede0">Lan's face turned red. She pulled the blanket over her and said.

</p><p data-p-id="66577b608a761c6f217a2e0ff8516af2">"That's what I always think?!"

</p><p data-p-id="a44c50fb898e9ef1d17373b4e48d1e1a">Eustaf blinked at the words. Lan was lifting up her upper body when she found a lace curtain that cut the bed in half.

</p><p data-p-id="630cf2c248baa9a0e03390509f36dacb">"What the hell is that curtain-- kwakk!"

</p><p data-p-id="94fa294c356da3f1675310d34b432341">Suddenly, her arm was pulled hard and her body was stuck in bed again.

</p><p data-p-id="378f866258cac49a4ab9b2afba5d14cb">I heard a really weird sound.

</p><p data-p-id="8dca5f4bc456e2a4e9985feca21e34ef">Lan frowned, thinking so, and there was Eustaf's face on the front.

</p><p data-p-id="73df839cd6a2e4234174108649300031">"When does it start?"

</p><p data-p-id="cf293129d428eee698f74440f93bfe84">"What?"

</p><p data-p-id="2471eb4133078989bc1327a12839d08f">"When did you think I was a man?"

</p><p data-p-id="287f45af718b32a155f09eb0cb1f2168">"That's-"

</p><p data-p-id="6ead29e9dfe427070a605fb37248ce29">What do you mean, Lan swallowed her breath when she saw his serious face.

</p><p data-p-id="6f2f8636f171b2abb95a8b4fa36f453d">Lan reached out slowly and wrapped his face around him. Her eyebrows are slightly distorted.

</p><p data-p-id="1191133ad8d33e90a08c7e0d3ca11f43">"Eustaf."

</p><p data-p-id="6e62182f1b815d1b629293bf580218b5">Lan called him carefully.

</p><p data-p-id="d7c37a5299b920b7fa1492204ab9a549">"What's so disturbing?"

</p><p data-p-id="8a5ac9097a1245401816a841282fb0a5">What do you want to check?

</p><p data-p-id="a52d5130a68603b8797c84ba687af3ab">"I like Eustaf. What should I say? First of all, it's not a job to get married without love, but it's something I've never imagined. We're still engaged, but-"

</p><p data-p-id="153e5d03ce96162b985ea5e9639b66a8">Lan gently swept his cheek and lightly pressed his lips.

</p><p data-p-id="94b1a4f87e7021fe91af255c69090691">"You're the only one I like."

</p><p data-p-id="4368bfc127d585b39ae3e9b4ca8a4eb1">Eustaf opened his eyes wide and blushed and buried his face in her neck.

</p><p data-p-id="870ca0e9ae4b522c1d8330e5864d479d">"······That's pathetic."

</p><p data-p-id="a73819a9d1eaba373bc5b081eec76050">"Youth?"

</p><p data-p-id="9c8eb507ed5359758a02d8bc2a145411">"That's why I can't help it because Lan is tender, but I have nothing to say."

</p><p data-p-id="6747d2b002a07e4cebd21aa770333f92">"!!"

</p><p data-p-id="df1467b0bfb1707d3f7dae3db2a46e2a">Lan opened her eyes round.

</p><p data-p-id="757b443caa5154dbec5327d22fe46424">"Did you care about that?!"

</p>

<p data-p-id="262ffc438bff356dbfa45756b3ee4561">"Of course I care."

</p><p data-p-id="d1e5e1d783d1d87cb52f984cbc87d6a5">"I thought Eustaf wouldn't care about that at all......" He stood up at her words.

</p><p data-p-id="4e4b9829be1cf01473af09a22ade45da">"I'm always conscious. I wonder if I'am a good match for Lan."

</p><p data-p-id="f5e3e3b24ab1b69e4aaee1d4845e7ca8">"Me?"

</p><p data-p-id="094f020bd3d34fc46886e58c6cb06e0a">Lan's emerald eyes are blinking. <br>Eustaf said quietly.

</p><p data-p-id="4e3dc2c462d0f86a9831b1d2f5efbdd8">"You could have run away as much as you could, but you didn't. You're not swayed by your uncle, you're working late at night until you fall down, and you're always so into my family-"

</p><p data-p-id="95e74309f83b914e1b02240c6c5df0e3">Clear eyes that look through this side.

</p><p data-p-id="c79266f1c75ddbc9e0603e25edc45666">I'm not searching, but I feel like I'm exploring.

</p><p data-p-id="ee1ce5b390c1ec5c4059c015c07a07e7">"Everything I have is given to me by Lan."

</p><p data-p-id="fd988aa58bc072ba73e9517036134d07">He grabbed her wrist and kissed her palms carefully. Lan's face was all red from the neck to the end of her ears.

</p><p data-p-id="d208e898f949664ad9e153836379ce15">"N, no, I'm not that great-"

</p><p data-p-id="9eaf8bc7389feba3b1cfded1170d3a34">"It's great to say that. I wanted to look trustworthy." Lan looked at Eustaf's awkward face.

</p><p data-p-id="849cb2ab98bce3f6d1e3365ff571ffd3">Oh, I've never seen a face like this before.

</p><p data-p-id="ffea07fb7138b2f471c0fb128428be3c">I'm sure I'm the only one who saw it.

</p><p data-p-id="7296e26d8b8d2edfa0044e68ecb67941">Eustaf's expression that only I know. Word, temperature, touch. <br>I was filled with loveliness.

</p><p data-p-id="c15c5149ea56d948d32f65fa892dbf89">"I always rely on you." Really, really. <br>Lan stretched out her arms, wrapped his neck, and hug him tightly.

</p><p data-p-id="3784184ec58e8d80915e80c237e7c3a8">'You're so cool and cute. Is it cute but cool?'

</p><p data-p-id="0fc148c696b8ec1e67ec44316fd3c88c">Eustaf's arms met her. And gently swept up her back. I'm so happy that Eustaf's touch over the thin silk pajamas.....

</p><p data-p-id="5fae94728225b523cf72ed8c3e398fa6">'Wait, I only have one underwear right now?'

</p><p data-p-id="416a05441b35850547709b0961442632">"You, Youth....."

</p><p data-p-id="c72f02126bf7674b0bdad5ea004b840f">An uneasy voice flowed out of itself. Eustaf paused and let her go.

</p><p data-p-id="77e3d5a9291880490d54915cffbba4fc">"I'm scared, Lan."

</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="07d4000b63d7a2ac1f0ba8f5fc5a2151">"Wielding a man this far."

</p><p data-p-id="3ebda3861cc5bb3be85ded211d67cdfe">"When am I?"

</p><p data-p-id="7f51168c5e68ef251370df31b5dd12a1">When Lan protested, he smirked, came down from the bed, headed across the bed, and lay down.

</p><p data-p-id="8066105280ac2af5dbae32d6473eb052">"Youth?"

</p><p data-p-id="d82afe593aec7ef141f2c49b08e0c5a5">"It's an engagement, so you can't come over this curtain."

</p><p data-p-id="ba81d4d1640539e47d3e3f8aa4099091">"You Just got over here!"

</p><p data-p-id="46711dea6f7cef212bb475e035545442">"It's impossible because I have to undress Lan."

</p><p data-p-id="976e8ea577f7f1c0ca7abef3ba2975d4">"Is this what Youth took off?!"

</p><p data-p-id="0c9faeb9a4a6020762cd708e5b2e7724">"Then who takes off the drunkard's clothes?"

</p><p data-p-id="64477c9646cef9fe8b123c580679622a">Lan turned red and crawled under the blanket.

</p><p data-p-id="cb532ba0fda47ba671879d010fa35dc2">"Don't come over now."

</p><p data-p-id="6509eff1259d96c618509b832d941e21">"Yes, yes."

</p><p data-p-id="ce08be10014b352a3a2b58b239c4cd66">After a brief silence, Lan said.

</p><p data-p-id="274214711dfdc4f4c49c6568f57d4c5b">"It's okay to cross your hand."

</p><p data-p-id="ec983c6fcbfacf2945754f8ed37af2cc">Eustaf smiled and reached out his hand over the lace curtain, and Lan held it together.

</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******

</p><p data-p-id="34539b83cfa1f55096818428f3e72c63">Sina held her head tightly.

</p><p data-p-id="5076cd02141bf1d85995c79ea25a4ea2">'Ahhhhh, crazy. You're crazy, Ishina!' <br>She rolled left and right three times in a big bed.

</p><p data-p-id="c6cb71fd62ae175c7590890d8b9bc749">'It's amazing that the bed doesn't fall off even after rolling like this.

</p><p data-p-id="d3fd91c3719baf25ad5262326bd8f0e1">The best in the world.'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>After thinking about it, Sina jumped up from her seat again.

</p>

<p data-p-id="0070d1cc53754bd3a90d79547a4b1def">'No! I'm really crazy. It's crazy!' <br>It was good to console Lumiere and to hold on to the strong liquor from the liquor store.

</p><p data-p-id="e75d216f8bd2b949f7896643411d1f5a">'I've heard about Lumiere's past.' <br>It wasn't a good story to think about again.

</p><p data-p-id="26305e346fa3c3673145ccbd0b85093a">The inside of my chest throbbed. <br>'But that's not the problem.'

</p><p data-p-id="83010df49fa724d141075db1e275fdfe">I remember that story. After that, the film was cut off from the middle.....

</p><p data-p-id="4d453717253b03c6eb3bba4ea61f9df9">'A bed naked when I woke up.' <br>The situation was so obvious that even a bad sound was not heard.

</p><p data-p-id="e746de29545f64e848a552ee7cebeb6f">She left Lumiere's room as if she was in a hurry to get dressed and run away.

</p><p data-p-id="d206255eb1e59da57aeaf8dac4b69aea">Since then, she has avoided running into Lumiere.

</p><p data-p-id="ed7e3c78f9a2aebc4096c0ee8ac2a965">'I'd like to talk to Ran Unnie.'

</p><p data-p-id="f8df606d28cba424060a8fcfd15a3b66">I couldn't even go to Lan and whine about the engagement.

</p><p data-p-id="e9cb0b4561dc88069e41c40f6fe4def6">Sina hurled all kinds of curses into her mouth and slashed at the feather pillow.

</p><p data-p-id="d21f30aafe60d452b8b739f8964c5838">'Tomorrow. Tomorrow, I will talk to Unnie.......'

</p><p data-p-id="b062669d4c75e8c0b03a80d6fed75c57">knock, knock

</p><p data-p-id="264d6fe734532018f3ed767df1d996bb">At that time, I heard a knock and shina shrugged her shoulders.

</p><p data-p-id="11744bf17cf57fef5fe0b8458dd9409a">"Who, who are you?"

</p><p data-p-id="bab793c57b99f800c28e9481bce2a636">"Me."

</p><p data-p-id="f473e3d9125ece9715f68750d9d0d659">That confidentness that doesn't even identify itself as Lumiere.

</p><p data-p-id="4dfc6d8d8da8a0b0e1309a4f8029156b">You shameless bastard. <br>Sina thought so and looked at the door and said,

</p><p data-p-id="ff00d7e298df414bca40a6aa52a55fd4">"I'm sleeping."

</p><p data-p-id="02ac119f6c1498ff9b52368d3b653e59">But the door opened without hesitation and Sina rolled down the bed.

</p><p data-p-id="1fee2566306295e546ce4d206e3d72c9">Hugging the feather pillow tightly like a shield, Sina said sharply.

</p><p data-p-id="f23c6c4abdf278008ab4288cb77e4486">"I, I said I was sleeping."

</p><p data-p-id="310a2a1f8196e159feac1a8ecda3f141">"Those who are sleeping do not answer that they are sleeping."

</p><p data-p-id="2055eb8dfabbcf976920c14f40d322ba">Lumiere said so and stared at Sina.<br><br>"Why are you avoiding me?"

</p><p data-p-id="40ebc731fc914fe18256f7372f588075">"......what......?"

</p><p data-p-id="8f2d12f43edd9690b4a9f1aa7390362b">I got sick for a moment and couldn't speak. Lumiere went on to say,

</p><p data-p-id="9ad3ff0977d0c2b495654be51f50d777">"Let's say avoiding me is. You were really looking forward to the engagement. You've tried on the dress several times. But You didn't dance and left the banquet hall."

</p><p data-p-id="f905b07a8dc4764fbb0d00a772c27aca">Lumiere leaned down slightly and smiled his unique cute smile.

</p><p data-p-id="01aeed4bbca9b77356fa5b9ef3a5ff25">"Isn't something wrong? Miss Sina?"

</p><p data-p-id="f3eb8c5a503e8ab21959594216e10296">At that moment, Sina hit him in the face with a feather pillow.

</p><p data-p-id="6d14e1fcc2f342e17a52feb273fbb186">"It's all because of you!!!"

</p><p data-p-id="0fa8d4d6f6d688a04de36dd42824664e">It was so strong that the feather pillow burst and feathers scattered everywhere.

</p><p data-p-id="3c91f9aaef6b4844fa9311064e1007ca">Lumiere caught Sina trying to swing her pillow a few more times. And he said,

</p><p data-p-id="cde07fcdc2e11099dacc2d2948bce3e1">"Oh, as expected."

</p><p data-p-id="6a03516e712ba87a668ff963f0ccd11d">"What? Oh, as expected?"

</p><p data-p-id="26a95a4a0b0d079fcad7268e188d0891">Sina was so angry that she couldn't speak. Lumiere kicked his tongue.

</p><p data-p-id="a36a4b0781e51775deb3655567594de3">"Aren't you surprised you were naked?"

</p><p data-p-id="18c2de230ec7efb95846291e69b4bb3e">"...."

</p><p data-p-id="8d08d5b8b09b9323c905065d37a33b21">Lumiere looked at Sinah with an expression of difficulty and said.

</p><p data-p-id="5f778fe1e42d8d82121af58b20574978">"I didn't Sleep."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

</p><p data-p-id="b5f92749817e5876d7e2863eaecd4d1f">"!!"

</p><p data-p-id="204b08591bdd99aaf02b598c8783439c">Sina's whole body flinched. Her black eyes began to shake wildly.

</p><p data-p-id="82ebd43d00fec42a1efb6a67ef34abf8">Lumiere sighed and said.

</p>

<p data-p-id="32816aaada99d47085274fb605c2e4e2">"You took off your clothes because you were drunk."

</p><p data-p-id="9c4ffcd6323ac7f97b715adc3936c401">"What....."

</p><p data-p-id="4e1cc7bdb2f00b901cfde9670869474d">"It's real. Don't you remember? You took off your clothes because it was hot, and you didn't listen to me even if I told you to stop, which is why I wrapped you in this blanket. You said you'd go out because it was hot."

</p><p data-p-id="210b55d689be0160e3b086f368f20702">"······!!"

</p><p data-p-id="d1fc26c1471b394cd55bea73c9fd060f">In an instant, Sina's face turned red as if it were on fire. At the same time, there was a sense of relief.

</p><p data-p-id="6c3765b102bf58d8c704f1cb2b3f0685">"Really? Well, why were you naked?"

</p><p data-p-id="128a411f370f87ff2cd5ec7b04c25fc0">"Because you spilled alcohol on me. Did I just take off my top...?"

</p><p data-p-id="2c07948d243acbe70473c77b668d0970">"Ah!"

</p><p data-p-id="0868758f0f6e5b8cf64cacdb48f2dfbf">Come to think of it, I only saw his naked upper body and not his lower body. Because it's so shocking that I'm taking off my clothes.

</p><p data-p-id="0d82934cde45a325c1a299159eb8d220">Sina said lastly.

</p><p data-p-id="1f75b343eee793b6833ec0ea1190742c">"Then, then I'll sleep separately. Isn't one bed too shameless?"

</p><p data-p-id="0f9879124d1c57e82dcfa5a8001e2d90">"Who told you not to go, to sleep with me, or to scream?"

</p><p data-p-id="4b83ee69fd0cb41e5206975fcdd3e50c">"Lie!"

</p><p data-p-id="c3ec00490e32f51a54ca7471cc99a8e2">"Really. Don't go drinking like that anywhere. I'm telling you."

</p><p data-p-id="5600f5e685543d313cb0f66330efc1eb">It was the limit of my patience not to faint, Lumiere sighed.

</p><p data-p-id="d703415234bca665e94fa0e167d4b156">"But it disappeared in the morning, so I can't see it, and you run away when I run into it. I came to see you on purpose because I'm sure you're misunderstanding me."

</p><p data-p-id="04023c9c856de448a6fb6a8b50608dee">"It, it would have been nice if you told me in advance..."

</p><p data-p-id="ef7a28453be76441561174497e58aba3">Lumiere caught Sina slipping away from her legs. Tears streamed down from her eyes.

</p><p data-p-id="37069de241b425ba59b21c5e159e9dc6">"I'm really surprised. And you missed all the engagements. Ouch-"<br><br>Lumiere reached out and wiped off her eyes and said.

</p><p data-p-id="dbf45d281df36313d26a7bd9119ab265">"So why don't you ask me as usual?"

</p><p data-p-id="da5657fb124038b1399c76d14bd7d199">Sina screamed a hundred times.

</p><p data-p-id="d80e0b51d69d9c86b56a7e2bacd1f57a">"Would you ask? Did I sleep? No, wait. But you've seen me, me, everything!"

</p><p data-p-id="f2be1f634bf75f3d178145b14609c081">"Ah!"

</p><p data-p-id="8b723a409f2547c9e164f6b0ab99c484">Lumiere was speechless for a moment and Sinah's face turned red.

</p><p data-p-id="8b4a97f8ab09da453a3afd1fc59e2b44">"Oh, I don't know, really!"

</p><p data-p-id="ca72791d73184d3a23c9918ceeb09185">Sina rushed to the bed, threw herself, and shouted to overcome embarrassment.

</p><p data-p-id="ce05cf1bd2ab7b350e218d67d1ee83a7">"Really! I'm all married!" Lumiere wondered what to say.

</p><p data-p-id="e043dc3393ad765838aea7d8f3b7661a">Was It pretty?

</p><p data-p-id="a6fb8cf9c901d0b855fb13d3ee730d9a">No.

</p><p data-p-id="718ab158ff39f6ce18365d4fb947892f">It didn't look good.

</p><p data-p-id="c20f2924464056fbea73602da572c2aa">"I couldn't see it."

</p><p data-p-id="33d76a9cf647704dfc87dce3df074228">"What?"

</p><p data-p-id="edeb2e654500a3a63226abe1785fc4e9">Lumiere coughed in vain and said.

</p><p data-p-id="90d8bfaaa7fbd89978ca95e6db138e73">"I can't remember well because I drank a lot, and I just can't remember well....."

</p><p data-p-id="28b4ef18216fc88ba7302669e66784c3">"Really······?"

</p><p data-p-id="356741cd28c8fe84c3bdf86510117794">Sina sneaked up her head on the bed and asked Lumiere, nodding his head.

</p><p data-p-id="f7815c8f2f3f2400a43bf1eaeff9f18e">She asked back, "Should I leave it like that?" and Lumiere nodded seriously again.

</p><p data-p-id="04b437681a8f1ffa812ce0219518f54b">"Yes, not at all, not a bit, I don't remember."

</p><p data-p-id="5b9f7fe6238b4d472f8a9cb97e8090ad">Sina slipped back out of bed, fanning her hands. Then she breathed out a breath.

</p><p data-p-id="88263568807b4b8d25fb3f1c65c9f7dc">"It's a mess. Really."

</p><p data-p-id="eb063aa2dfc495f6229b42ec1ff723b7">"That's true."

</p><p data-p-id="375f1985ed444cd4fcecbcb09f308bf0">Lumiere said so and gave up while taking the feathers off her head. Sina looked down at her furry dress and said,

</p><p data-p-id="b07c7c4695ac5792a981b62666c70458">"We can't go to the ball now, can we?"

</p><p data-p-id="d539631529fd655e3045ed9822f3f848">"I'd look like a lady who was robbing a feather blanket."

</p><p data-p-id="fcc5f3ffa88ca2a261134ac9486e5522">Besides, it's close to wavelength time. <br>Sina sighed and Lumiere reached out her hand.

</p><p data-p-id="09e231e782ba958c3724e1e88f103ca8">"Shall we dance now?"

</p><p data-p-id="951ae2e773f1ed3e1ca64692d991f4b6">"What?"

</p><p data-p-id="5af366747b240a3380425da82a55bb27">"Dance"

</p><p data-p-id="1e33e916f713bd992cc5052a103d5971">Sina blinked her eyes.

</p><p data-p-id="53402ad348f3c23cb3113f37c7a8d4e8">"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="4657e0238b2a093da3f8194eb6a69b91">"Yeah, You haven't even taken off your dress yet."

</p><p data-p-id="35f170262e3ddeba3267b208eaefefea">"That's it....."

</p><p data-p-id="d96dd0e4d5e86f7b7067fd42e8a04450">Since it's been a long time, I wanted to keep wearing it because it's pretty. Looking down, Sina realized that she was completely covered with feathers as well as the Rumi.

</p><p data-p-id="9e8d9e5cf2815f43843b18ce789e9b6b">"Huh? It's completely feathery, isn't?"

</p><p data-p-id="0677cc1f4b435144db4a5103a1097dfc">"Because the feather pillow burst."

</p><p data-p-id="5356e27d4235ed75252ea147ab6fac9b">"It's all about Lumie. Oh, how do I do this? When the maids see you tomorrow--"

</p><p data-p-id="07aef5a9e8c500143bb66eb10e9ded8c">Only then did Sina look around in embarrassment. Not only Lumiere and herself, but also feathers were all over the place.

</p><p data-p-id="f20ad0c659bf12e0aa4e7197b7264f21">Lumiere smirked and said.

</p><p data-p-id="f12bfcf5ad87287098c373f8f3e3e74b">"I'll clean it up later."

</p><p data-p-id="a433aa7fd83f3fe7f16e994e4cd7d7a7">"That's the problem."

</p><p data-p-id="4d9ca2812844e8f4cffbfcbc33586856">"You can't help it now, can you? But I can't dance here. Let's dance on the veranda."

</p><p data-p-id="d392717eeaa2d6fa92869fe659a93306">Sina was dragged out to the veranda as he led her. It was a mild weather without wind for Lazia.

</p><p data-p-id="6b5f5bfbd892cbbdacd712d546169d4a">Lumiere thought he had been on the veranda like this before. Lan said she'd teach me how to dance.

</p><p data-p-id="09590208e315393f8d8361972856b004">But now Sina and I are together.

</p><p data-p-id="facb95030e493014c9349ba9c1d28dae">"Would you like to do a song?"

</p><p data-p-id="02b00131bc27b959148875f2875bf01d">Sina smiled and held his hand as she asked politely with a feather.

</p><p data-p-id="25d6a0c8b3abc799ba97d32db9f7b11f">"Of course."

</p><p data-p-id="b32782d8adc7a71bd72e9228b20ffed6">Even on the narrow veranda, the doublet was not difficult to dance.

</p><p data-p-id="df1b30d14a062cd6819736ffb2334833">Sina asked carefully.

</p><p data-p-id="822d09808506a8b4727037d58a278277">"Are you okay now?"

</p><p data-p-id="0eb14f3d83878db9ff9171f3fec18625">"What?"

</p><p data-p-id="7dcdc6ea30811cd45aceca4441ed4588">"I mean Lan Unnie's engagement."

</p><p data-p-id="52e8ab5230b6180be332ce6081310cc7">Lumiere looked down at Sina for a moment. You must have been worried a lot just now, but as soon as it's resolved, you worry about others.

</p><p data-p-id="54108f1501c9fe82f50b9494dee1e7a6">"Thanks to you drinking with me yesterday, I'm fine."

</p><p data-p-id="9e60125cc6165ab8b98933849b98cc17">"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="b2cb0e3f89727e4b153523ce4530ba6c">"Yes, thanks to you, I could say congratulations. Thank you."

</p><p data-p-id="be3be9fe69facab49022b349180c377c">Sina smiled brightly at the frank greeting.

</p><p data-p-id="eec64fa55af12a27488a5fb73cf92393">'Strange.'

</p><p data-p-id="623c0ba78d7f65cf7198c37a5200d4f4">Sina cried, so I felt relieved. I've never heard anyone cry for me.

</p><p data-p-id="7d5ab0156f966ba02d1f1aea3a6a13db">But really, it's okay because she cried.

</p><p data-p-id="55659c6582fb6814f006e00f037ee637">Lumiere thought so and danced leisurely.
