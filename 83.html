<p data-p-id="d4f7c8e75babaeb2c0cc9ed613057119">I couldn't get enough of it even if I kept looking.

</p><p data-p-id="cff088e4398a8d9b46320284d80b511c">'But I'm not, am I?'

</p><p data-p-id="4e0a7409f0bb0ad70672f6a9cd8b2741">Eustaf savored what Ran had said. <br>I don't say it, even if I get hurt. <br>Of course, it's different if you can't hide it, but I just handled the minor wounds by myself. Like Ran said, I thought I should never show my enemies or my men that I’m hurt.

</p><p data-p-id="004b61951be0926f03b33b1edd3f580f">But Ran says she's okay, and she agrees with that.

</p><p data-p-id="e3af1705de64fd291000c824f6fab122">'I'm in deeper trouble.'

</p><p data-p-id="85dd6e59361c2f5a632d96dde429ab22">Eustaf leaned down and leaned his head against her shoulder.

</p><p data-p-id="d9ccc6f34cb012187616e7fbcabe4b05">"Eus, don't move, just stay still."

</p><p data-p-id="5dbe75a1d0e212118a48566dea5c21b6">Ran said so, but didn't blame him for leaning on with wet hair. Instead, she reached out her opposite hand and stroked his hair, applying ointment to the wound. Eustaf thought it was really, really difficult.

</p><p data-p-id="2c4aad9f928ae8a839d5b72314a67c87">'Anxious.'

</p><p data-p-id="bbbfd00cef2b4d39d51c0adbc22ee0db">I was so anxious that I couldn't stand it. She is his lover.

</p><p data-p-id="44a4d323c3471253e490e261da0576d9">For now.

</p><p data-p-id="5ba1a0b2d743bc700757b23381c9ae44">The 'now' part was unbearable.

</p><p data-p-id="ec98fc30ad8bfef2c24a596e8edc2e4c">'If Ran goes away.'

</p><p data-p-id="71adbdf629a6798e26b99d7519874bf6">What will happen to me?

</p><p data-p-id="ca947a7d615af2835c2114d80677ce58">It was hard to imagine. I mean, I can imagine it so well that it's not realistic.

</p><p data-p-id="3301672f013b161c43800cec05e65781">"I'm done. All we have to do is put some bandage on it later on. Straight up for a second."

</p><p data-p-id="27a677366d952e79b87cd66e20757b4a">Ran pushed him away, and Eustaf stretched his back gently. Ran looked very proud only after putting on the wet blanket she received from the therapist.

</p><p data-p-id="abfeac1f6d356774f25148dbf070c53f">"That's it. If you don't feel better, call a therapist. Okay?"

</p><p data-p-id="4ab998b30ccb1c13c6a053be209959e4">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="5e994dc2019ecbe944705bff87b2363e">Eustaf put his shirt back on and said, and then Ran glanced at his abs and body.

</p><p data-p-id="ee852599b6567294004fbeabd0e46280">Eustaf whispered.

</p><p data-p-id="e0d5e9c164430720083299b7f098b8a5">"What all you've seen so far?"

</p><p data-p-id="1089cbfbc97421fd4ec76f876ce2bb21">"That its already cure?"

</p><p data-p-id="7461c68fadb0446da4f43b1cafd80091">He smiled and kissed in a sulky way.

</p><p data-p-id="8285a79475107956754181321a69c40d">'Ah'

</p><p data-p-id="da7cd5942c8c8b0dae88beab66831789">Ran closed her eyes and accepted that he had repeatedly overlapped lips.

</p><p data-p-id="f6d345212c6c0f533a3dc950c9c2afe7">'This is a big deal.'

</p><p data-p-id="3a701b9ab038ee611ea57de12349830a">I like Eustaf more and better.

</p><p data-p-id="5da03554f9b23d20cb54cb0af710471c">Just like falling into sweet honey, the heart grew bigger and bigger after the four seasons.

</p><p data-p-id="34ecd85bc0e0f2b3753a58740507f70a">I'm scared because I'm happy.

</p><p data-p-id="8c5e833220718ee25ee9b92f3ad614d1">Ran opened her eyes thinking so. <br>&emsp; <br>'I used to think these eyes were scary.'

</p><p data-p-id="b8a7b1bc386b4e80c87858be7b33c658">Eyes like an ice sea that I don't know what he's thinking. But I'm not scared anymore.

</p><p data-p-id="dbced12168677527ed2f55ced66e98a9">Sweet, friendly-

</p><p data-p-id="96712f168e456f3fe910eed6ec999d9d">'Oh, are you scared now?'

</p><p data-p-id="e4ae822d877a4a1fb0ef3911b9be5350">Eyes filled with dark desire.

</p><p data-p-id="c4e34b1ac8f23ff6021407000abf66db">Ran exhaled and lowered her eyes.

</p><p data-p-id="dc608fc034084a919ac3d5f702c2d743">'No, it's not scary, it's exciting.'

</p><p data-p-id="7efc6231c84ecc1aebb3029671f16810">I want to kiss you more, stay together, and touch you.

</p><p data-p-id="98d2256f673b7c4dff0b0046fe0cc4b4">A little more, a little more.

</p><p data-p-id="736694433473dc29a5d9ff6923c15004">'Not enough.'

</p><p data-p-id="19155e64e8d2633c1ea6cefae91eab38">Ran looked up and saw Eustaf, and this time, he stretched out and kissed her.

</p><p data-p-id="4f9e376fc3bedc979c2cad1117bd3426">Eustaf pulled her waist and kissed her deeper. Rough and violent, friendly and polite. <br>I don't know how it can coexist, but it did anyway. <br>Ran out of breath after the kiss. Her cheeks were burning up and her lips glistened. Her eyes blushed and she glanced at Eustaf and smiled awkwardly.

</p>

<p data-p-id="f30454d6063d418e5f83bdf8878caa29">"I can't live without our servants."

</p><p data-p-id="4d383a6d75a4ea3cb8fb29101cc4cf10">At her words, Eustaf paused. A long time later, he said.

</p><p data-p-id="eb063aa2dfc495f6229b42ec1ff723b7">"That's true."

</p><p data-p-id="07f6beeaab8957fb6ae395f49b6b990c">Eustaf whispered softly. <br>"Ran"

</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="95f7d2b7b3dd2f8c84df32b8bce757b0">"Can't I have a little more monopoly?" Ran laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="31d183f8eb66217801a9a8ea082a7368">"You're already doing it, aren't you?"

</p><p data-p-id="3300d16d9ca9862d51150209e12bfcf4">"A little more."

</p><p data-p-id="c3bb6fd74de3afd9f50f43f37e54a8ad">"More?"

</p><p data-p-id="e5c071435ed03b853222da6ae9ca254a">"Try to limit the eyes that I can pull out of other man that look at you."

</p><p data-p-id="63c8dfcfdb40e2659279bda87f0cd93e">"I don't have that limit anywhere." Ran murmured.

</p><p data-p-id="df2d374d3280bdbd0b1b04b21b3b85b6">"Can't we get engaged?"

</p><p data-p-id="2a9fa3994ce1f138b06a7498ace4c06d">At Eustaf's words, Ran took a short breath. Eustaf smiled at the reaction.

</p><p data-p-id="0e892dc3f48ae3ea5389cea2648f75b1">"If you say no, I can't help it."

</p><p data-p-id="f12afaf1234a5f95182b6523a7dfd90d">"Eus, I…"

</p><p data-p-id="2e928c2a00b8bbd2bb64401b3968dd30">Ran couldn't figure out what to say. <br>If you wait a little longer, your destiny will come?!

</p><p data-p-id="f98ca1b87b812a1772c6c1f7d9817863">'Oh, not this one again.'

</p><p data-p-id="02a4148be856f9b2333a8bd84c59f816">Ran corrected herself for a moment.<br><br>"Eus"

</p><p data-p-id="1a0ceb7935bc827c6efec6a972f10404">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="bac919a5fcbf1738be20a7936a30ea2d">"Next year."

</p><p data-p-id="708600e3d23eab9eec0f1b9761703bce">His eyes widening. Ran smiled.

</p><p data-p-id="339d2965ea657bcd913d37b5b0de8210">"Shall we do it next spring? If Eus don't change his mind until then."

</p><p data-p-id="53402ad348f3c23cb3113f37c7a8d4e8">"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="a7b4cf092aff568ca17578891ee4a1dc">Eustaf quickly asked back, and Ran nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="c261b83f1a94d4b274654f2babcf0608">'If you don't change your mind.'

</p><p data-p-id="17ccb10823709b31c24d81136ee2885f">Eustaf said with a strange smile on his face.

</p><p data-p-id="15c8b88339601cfba6a214b646160e2d">"If you're forcing yourself, you don't have to."

</p><p data-p-id="85ebadb67e9735c59531ae8312eacfac">"It's not like that."

</p><p data-p-id="6b286aecb9522fbb3e1db292e72a1146">Ran shook her head. Eustaf reached out and wrapped her round cheek. <br>The only thing that came to mind when the monster said "Lazia."

</p><p data-p-id="3e4ede0e478dd546dd48f4dccaf20b60">My everything, My precious things. <br>Lazia is everything to himself. <br>I've always thought so, but what came to mind then was Ran.

</p><p data-p-id="97305ea8df9083ad55cc87beff7cc075">"It's a big deal."

</p><p data-p-id="cf293129d428eee698f74440f93bfe84">"What?"

</p><p data-p-id="4379b615ea366cb8ecf02c1d731b0ccf">"I want to eat you all up."

</p><p data-p-id="e2f5a4c36eb38cb693b7252d956a83a7">Eustaf said so and kissed her again. <br>It was a really appetizing kiss. <br>Ran asked with a curious face.

</p><p data-p-id="4a376f703b6373ed22832996e2deffb2">"You cut its throat and it's survived?"

</p><p data-p-id="81f3fae0e3a98ff5027eeb135d7d3c1c">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="99caf1b8f57ad9fe01566c720cc0b8a4">Eustaf nodded. He wondered whether to tell Ran this story or not. <br>What if she wants to leave here even more? <br>I managed to get an engagement appointment next spring, but I might miss it. <br>But I couldn't help but talk to Ran. <br>Because as she said, she was neither a subordinate nor an enemy, nor a partner who looked at the same place as him.

</p><p data-p-id="be53e404635e75ecc4ce50cc2a7bce3b">Ran said as she slipped a plate of mash potatoes in front of Eustaf.

</p><p data-p-id="235e123635d003fc2c29d1eef2a4c7db">"How could you do that...then…what happen?"

</p><p data-p-id="e908f0cc4542402ca6482298678f8ec2">"He swung his tail, and I was caught with it."

</p><p data-p-id="e1600cb4e36c1b98aa65e8caba2277e9">"So, your sides…."

</p><p data-p-id="33a72079efc97fc07484c0ca756a859f">"I was saved because of my armor. If it weren't for that, the bones would have been broken and the intestines ruptured."

</p><p data-p-id="d6b522955ea7f4564bbace447fd27936">Ran opened her mouth because he told such a horrible story so calmly.

</p><p data-p-id="e6a15450379669876dc985cad9a31696">"Eustaf Laban de Lazia!"

</p><p data-p-id="5a7f6e55c1a2c2321329668ed3c83a6e">"It's been a long time since I heard my full name from you." Ran sighed deeply.

</p>

<p data-p-id="8653929738e7b6fdc8997cee9214dfb2">"I'm so glad you're okay."

</p><p data-p-id="26bb435a39de43386dc8879a288bb9c1">Eustaf nodded. Then he talked about what the monster had left behind, and Ran listen to it seriously and then said it.

</p><p data-p-id="86af75beac4d623ce6631358ca047a31">"I found something in the library, too." Eustaf's eyes were distinctive.

</p><p data-p-id="9818d3ec4519149f7d62c3362ea8b9aa">"Have you found any records?"

</p><p data-p-id="0f55ad8d304541f2986e2604a86a78cc">"That- there's some magic in the Viridescent Crown."

</p><p data-p-id="c0813e290da1b9119c3fd1de3e07b7f8">"Even in the crown?"

</p><p data-p-id="df5e4bbb334047bf891a910a61faff16">"Yes, and have you ever heard about Delphanto?" Eustaf thought for a while and shook his head.

</p><p data-p-id="cec11cf4e6b578a699f7505e1bd1ba00">"No, I haven't heard of that name before."

</p><p data-p-id="bb40940cb8afe9db244a916861899a5f">"The ancestors of Lazia, I mean, a thousand years ago. When he built the Sky castle with Iveria, the great wise one, he wrote down a story." A thousand years.

</p><p data-p-id="d8eda0090faa09316f625bba36f46c5e">It's huge when I think about it. <br>Eustaf frowned and asked, "Does the language work?"

</p><p data-p-id="0858258e998594350109545417ee13bc">"Yes, it did." Ran answered.

</p><p data-p-id="da45fa26ad708a72c2af64615083fbdb">In fact, whether it's an ice stool privilege or something, all languages seem to have roughly the same meaning.

</p><p data-p-id="68e26d2b6208423b86e9fd939cf2acf6">"Yeah, I'll translate it." <br>Ran murmured.

</p><p data-p-id="6447e1c63e1532272668a957f436720a">You may see yourself comfortably, but it may be difficult for <br>people who don't know the language. For future generations, it would be better to translate it now. <br>There's nothing to do anyway. <br>In a world without television or the Internet, entertainment was like playing cards or board games.

</p><p data-p-id="050efb6ec957deec2367841c7a99ad58">"Oh, yeah, there were some secret channels. Do you know about it, Eustaf? The secret passage?"

</p><p data-p-id="c1e881918d57168338e8e797c3e131a5">"I know some of them. But I wonder if it’s the same passage."

</p><p data-p-id="2f5d28f853bc09d5c90664eaf5075c35">"I found one, too." <br>Ran whispered and laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="bec694f147592d174c95387751f639e1">"Actually, Lumiere found it, not me."<br><br>Lumiere's name came out and Eustaf paused and asked.

</p><p data-p-id="63ccec19155faaa9c5de6ef4fdc7a021">"What about to him?"

</p><p data-p-id="d9968dd069a6025fe9e1c912e1f4621c">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="c009b9b75bf27920bb6fdd744090ddeb">"He seems to have changed somehow. You remove him as your escort."

</p><p data-p-id="957d016eba0e76998f5111fd900a34d7">"Oh..well..."

</p><p data-p-id="a6605518fcd84dfc9bb735ee8b144711">Ran contemplated, should I say, 'Lumiere confessed to me and so I kicked him out as my escort?'

</p><p data-p-id="f3f61996da6965b13ac95ad8518437b0">Then when I glance at Eus face, I hardened my mind and told myself, 'I should just tell him,' so Ran whispered.

</p><p data-p-id="5f0c981604d451d472eb8e87e26a6e81">"It should be a secret."

</p><p data-p-id="b294e9ea773d9ed9024f224cf95783cc">"What is?"

</p><p data-p-id="2aa747aa1fd54aadebfcb1cba611a708">"Lumiere told me he liked me." Eustaf's face stiffened.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>"Everyone knows that."

</p><p data-p-id="49c4479c71f9b087a472c245853c3da1">"Really?!"

</p><p data-p-id="b152587a0940906e2f3973094857f4ad">When Ran opened her eyes wide in surprise, Eustaf said, "You're the only one who doesn't know."

</p><p data-p-id="7dc7d8391035db43338984a9741caa1a">That's why she didn't even know about his feelings before. <br>Ran stuttered in embarrassment at the words and said,

</p><p data-p-id="f1f86a9cf4b3f8ac878e1f58c711093f">"Well I… I said I liked Eus, and so, I rejected him."

</p><p data-p-id="b3053e81cc72444786e0581304d3fedb">"Is that all?"

</p><p data-p-id="fa35cceac44d9a9efdc4a8d2b50f1624">"Yes- and I've talked about something else, but that's beside the point."

</p><p data-p-id="c955fed67c6d864efc5d12680080716b">Ran says so and puts her elbows on the table and slaps her chin. She looks like she'll be scolded for being rude, but neither did she care.

</p><p data-p-id="01a610866a9b0894bff729dd7b688bed">"Hurry up and eat a lot. That way, you'll get better soon."

</p><p data-p-id="0ed4cdc42b65d4a38f50b5aeb625940b">She pushed another plate back to the Eustaf, he asked,

</p><p data-p-id="777363960b2d06740455650857d39803">"Don't you want to eat more, Ran?"

</p><p data-p-id="35a912a7603cc56de47a8668599c5069">"I already ate a lot."

</p><p data-p-id="021921b5c7109eb500fe1ff39b08dedc">"What about training these days?"

</p>

<p data-p-id="7ddf95d484014c0273f29324c4a17a8f">"It's really – really hard." Ran made a noise.

</p><p data-p-id="16e2248b310b16419c5b655a2f0587b1">"But I think it's worth it. If I continue to train myself like this, I think I will be able to lift Eustaf."

</p><p data-p-id="c27bd875e9bf45f19cdab76bf4d005e2">"I don't expect that much, but I'll practice with you when you start practicing swordsmanship."

</p><p data-p-id="9e60125cc6165ab8b98933849b98cc17">"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="d316a43023fe92eb7d04bc4403ded33f">"Really."

</p><p data-p-id="c0a3a58c0b96a21d57795a102602dd55">Eustaf nodded. Ran said, "Oh."

</p><p data-p-id="13e271bafff008722cd8b1698bfaedd4">"Let’s return to what we are discussing earlier…where did you put the crown?"

</p><p data-p-id="3600db93c5f30e5320c9eaf632435a6f">"It'll be in the treasure room."

</p><p data-p-id="286593ba6e727e52fb90d7ec424c3d66">"I see. Can I take a look?"

</p><p data-p-id="11a1297d324b147ad6884099e138238f">"It’s for the future owner."

</p><p data-p-id="d0e54621a32a52613fd446f19433020e">At Eustaf's words, Ran only smiled, but did not answer.

</p><p data-p-id="b7a9fbb121b341b7ddccb173ab3ab076">"Maybe there is a clue how to the ideal with the 'door'... <br>Eustaf, do you know what's on the door?"

</p><p data-p-id="e1961e2dbb7378b9671eb3ff7fd3d671">"I only understand that there's a 'dark'."

</p><p data-p-id="6ddf5dcfc5f0a3809ed134e46825b0e0">"No, not that abstract." <br>At Ran's words, Eustaf shook his head.

</p><p data-p-id="ee4f7cf90330e0e45df05416ce460609">"I don't know. There may be something that comes down to the owner of the house, but maybe it was lost in the middle."

</p><p data-p-id="d2d2ceafce19dfb7f2a0a7c7c635cc5d">"I see, it's from thousand years ago. There's no way we can find anything from a thousand years ago."

</p><p data-p-id="694729152384ed4a4a61312efe0ab172">If you were simply trying to convey the story in a phrase, this is too complacent.

</p><p data-p-id="3afc383be297a34078d016b429892509">Ran frowned. <br>'I'm sure there's something.'

</p><p data-p-id="c5a88b0ca40fb0914a7d59e150e751de">She's a great wise one. Great wise one. <br>She's not a fool at all.

</p><p data-p-id="cc7cb9d596a9d4f4f775eb5df104205a">'Or didn't you think the seal would be this long?' Ran sighed, still contemplating.

</p><p data-p-id="2b54c8a965abe394b9f28bef1e6ff656">"There's nothing to worry about."

</p><p data-p-id="51bf82ff73d0e4657f117d14a3a30fba">Ran slowly smiled at Eustaf's words.<br><br>"Yes."

</p><p data-p-id="17820c7f6a6920971770fd4957874746">I know that. <br>In her short reply, Eustaf smiled back.

</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******

</p><p data-p-id="6bf57bf389d0539dbed3eef8a4cc6d26">Time flew by quickly. <br>The early winter of Lazia began in earnest, and Eustaf said he would leave for winter hunt even before his injury was healed, making Ran's eyes flutter.

</p><p data-p-id="6bad147cb5a18afa59f8c6c037cc67a4">Eustaf did change his mind, saying he should go even though he looked regretful and gave her a soothing kiss.

</p><p data-p-id="b520f1dafd4054ff3afa12f01f0d559b">'I liked that regreful look, so I tried to make it worse.' Ran held back her smile.

</p><p data-p-id="d159e0bfb55e63dc3c806cd83285a596">She knew she couldn't help it either. <br>She just wanted to be a little bit stubborn. <br>Ran saw him off, telling him to be careful. <br>Instead, Eustaf told Ran to feel free to enter the treasure room. Thanks to him, Ran was able to look through the Viridescent Crown as much as she can.

</p><p data-p-id="d0d9dbbba6bf3bedac8b267916232881">'But I really couldn’t find any clue.' <br>I told Frances, but he shook his head, saying there was no magical feeling.

</p><p data-p-id="0cfc6ad80afd238f19583c37718b47a3">'What the hell is this?'

</p><p data-p-id="24488dbcc5ce66abc5eee7d8d6b89ec6">What kind of magic is at stake here? <br>'The truth is that it's not magic, maybe it's just a loving heart?' <br>Ran squinted and looked at the emerald Crown. <br>And I wiped it clean with a handkerchief and put it back on the velvet cushion.

</p><p data-p-id="f083a3c16dfba386dd40a9a988146796">Although there were not many items in Lazia's treasure room, each one boasted a history and tradition.

</p><p data-p-id="276a0060e3bec0c6f3857b14c0a68191">'You're a thousand-year-old with denim and recording.'

</p><p data-p-id="50e5dc5fc25411fb8cbba62f8dcf6e1f">Some things are even over a hundred years old.

</p><p data-p-id="f20386b1a128eeaf741fe455c877217d">There was no jewelry that my mother bought because it was literally a "treasure." It was kept in an emerald room separately.

</p><p data-p-id="cc8143ff9c6df24fa8879829d8084070">'Here's the clue again.' She sighed.<br><br>"I would like to asked something if there were people whose around thousand years ago."

</p><p data-p-id="195c7ce371fe9b1258bad3965712dbe3">As soon as I muttered, an idea pop out like a lightning.

</p><p data-p-id="48eb4402a6ccde99e269e7a4ce947413">'Wait, there's someone who was there a thousand years ago, and there's someone who knows them'

</p><p data-p-id="73214ee58d24803fb5f77550aaaa1ff9">Although it is a spirit, not a person, it has existed since Iveria first built the wall.

</p><p data-p-id="68b11e21e0b9504d0434b3c2dde54c72">'Wouldn't they know?'

</p><p data-p-id="fe7383e3a11db0aeffbac53575d74045">Ran thought so and pondered for a while.

</p><p data-p-id="c428d0f9d104544685f37bbe68755cb4">'I think there was more data on spirits.'

</p><p data-p-id="c601411bf61ff8177e537724d8b7fd86">I remembered seeing the list in the library. Let's gather some of the spirits' favorite things and ask Eastarif to do it.

</p><p data-p-id="2f15a254d6042efe99a315ea3479ffaf">Ran left the treasure house thinking so.

</p><p data-p-id="b4ecc3b0ba4f731e151cb66547297e00">I tried to looked some details about the spirits in the library, but they were different. It’s all unreliable. <br>'How the hell did Iveria make Eastarif get in the ring?'

</p><p data-p-id="e2124dc562d2a1f9350eac0735e1d494">Ran then collected what some spirits would like as she investigated.

</p><p data-p-id="18415fbfe080f6331b30ace627f7fc0c">And carefully called the spirit. <br>"Eastarif."

</p><p data-p-id=845"a7cb9465a88405162a46a47477fde05d">But there was no answer. <br>"Eastarif?"

</p><p data-p-id="114609ebfceec8d0cd0d3ec4b492fb12">I shouted into the air a few more times, but the reaction did not come back, and Ran woke up feeling awkward.

</p><p data-p-id="1ce490e418ca9ebcde6bd3a432af05dd">'Why isn't she coming?' <br>And that evening, Ran had a dream similar to the past. <br>
