        <p>"Isn't it the capital bothering you?"</p>

        <p>Bother? What? Why?</p>

        <p>Ran shook her head when she saw Lumiere with a suspicious face.</p>

        <p>"No, if not, that's fine."</p>

        <p>Only then did Lumiere realize that she thought her expression was dark because of the organization of the slums.</p>

        <p>'I totally forgot.'</p>

        <p>How shallow a person's memory is?</p>

        <p>It's been a long time since I've lived like this, and it felt like a long time ago that I rolled on the floor like that.</p>

        <p>"It's the Emperor that bothers me."</p>

        <p>Leaning on her lap, Lumiere said, Lan laughed bitterly.</p>

        <p>"It's okay. It's okay."</p>

        <p>It's okay?</p>

        <p>Lumiere almost told her about the last attack. Since then, I have asked Blaine, but Blaine has also informed that he has not been reported to The Viridescent Shadow since.</p>

        <p>Lumiere was a little surprised by the gentle information, but soon thanked him.</p>

        <p>'So, did Eustaf get a report?'</p>

        <p>Lumiere thought so and his eyes sharpen.</p>

        <p>"I need to get my hair."</p>

        <p>At that time, Ran, who touched his hair said, and Lumiere smiled softly.</p>

        <p>"Are you cutting me off?"</p>

        <p>"No, no, no. If I cut it, it'll be like a rat dug up." Ran waved her hand.</p>

        <p>Then Kara said.</p>

        <p>"Then do you want me to cut it for you?"</p>

        <p>"Oh, yeah. Kara cuts hair so well. She cut my hair, too."</p>

        <p>In the past, Kara gently removed the damaged part and cut the long hair lightly. Considering that skill, it won't be difficult to trim Lumiere's hair.</p>

        <p>Lumiere nodded.</p>

        <p>"Then I'll ask Kara."</p>

        <p>"Should I cut what I decided now anyway?"</p>

        <p>When Kara said so, Lumiere replied, "Okay," and the two went out to the veranda together.</p>

        <p>As soon as the two went out, Dimodia said in a cheap rap.</p>

        <p>"You're too close."</p>

        <p>"Huh?"</p>

        <p>"Lumiere and the Countess. You two are too close. It's way beyond the average man and woman's closeness."</p>

        <p>"I know."</p>

        <p>"You know? You know that?"</p>

        <p>"There's something psychologically disturbing about Lumiere, so just lean on me until it is. He'll be all right in a minute."</p>

        <p>"It's already been a year. How long will you be pampered? Hurry up and send him somewhere else."</p>

        <p>Ran smiled awkwardly at the words. I couldn't let Lumiere go somewhere.</p>

        <p>'When Sina comes-'</p>

        <p>What are you going to do when she come?</p>

        <p>Suddenly, I thought that.</p>

        <p>It will not continue with Sina and Lumiere anyway. It's about Sina and Eustaf. But do we really need to tie Lumiere here?</p>

        <p>Ran thought so, but there was a knock on the door.</p>

        <p>"Who is it?"</p>

        <p>"It's me."</p>

        <p>"Oh, come on in."
        </p>

        <p>Ran said with a glaring voice from Eustaf. Ran asked questions to Eustaf who came in.</p>

        <p>"What did he say? Does he want me to come here to talk to him? Or will he approve it? Or what else did he just say?"</p>

        <p>"They told me to enter."</p>

        <p>"Hmm."</p>

        <p>"Right now."</p>

        <p>"Really?"</p>

        <p>Ran opened her eyes wide and frowned tightly.</p>

        <p>"He's not even funny. He's always been like that."</p>

        <p>"Let's go for now."</p>

        <p>"Will it be all right?"</p>

        <p>Ran murmured in fear.</p>

        <p>I was worried about what abnormal ways the opponent would come out because it was a common sense or emergency food.</p>

        <p>For example, threatening with force, etc.,·······.</p>

        <p>"It'll be all right."</p>

        <p>Eustaf said so after taking a deep breath.</p>

        <p>"I'd like to leave blue ring with-"</p>

        <p>"Never."</p>

        <p>Ran jumped out of her seat and said. But now that my height only came to Eustaf's chest, she realized how tall he had grown.</p>

        <p>"Blue ring is the last bastion. It doesn't make sense to leave it to me when I don't know what's going to happen."</p>

        <p>If there is a spirit, the occasional armed demonstration can be overcome. At Ran's words, Eustaf nodded. What she said was not wrong. Still, I was anxious, so I wanted to save it for Ran.</p>

        <p>'Oh, my God.'</p>

        <p>Eustaf laughed.</p>

        <p>Now, he is the only successor to Lazia, and after he dies, it is over. Indeed, Baron Lowry Lindbergh - his uncle may be given a leach.</p>

        <p>So, my life always comes first, and now Ran's life is valued more than his own. Eustaf stretched out his hands and stopped and bit.</p>

        <p>"Can I hug you?"</p>

        <p>Ran hugged him tightly first at the words.</p>

        <p>"It's okay to hug without asking."</p>

        <p>Eustaf hugged her.</p>

        <p>******</p>

        <p>Lumiere looked into the room, listening to the sound of his hair being cut off. Kara said after the last pair of scissors.</p>

        <p>"I'm done cutting."</p>

        <p>"Thank you."</p>

        <p>Lumiere, who was sitting on a chair, looked back at her and said hello. Kara only then looked into the room and laughed,</p>

        <p>"Oh?"</p>

        <p>"Don't they two look good together?"</p>

        <p>There was implicit pressure on Kara's words, and Lumiere answered smoothly.</p>

        <p>"Yes, they look good."</p>

        <p>There is a river between Ran and himself that cannot be crossed. Ran's leaning toward Eustaf seemed so transparent to Lumiere.</p>

        <p>'What if.'</p>

        <p>What happens if I confess?</p>

        <p>Lumiere thought about it. he's weak-minded and friendly, and Eustaf has everything, but if I say you're the only one, you might say you'll get it with a difficult face.</p>

        <p>With her new identity, the two may be able to flee far away.</p>

        <p>Maybe, at least you'll refuse Eustaf's confession?</p>

        <p>After thinking about it, Lumiere opened the door with a bitter smile.</p>

        <p>Ran was about to let go of Eustaf at the sound of the door, but Eustaf hugged her tightly one more time and looked up at Lumiere.</p>

        <p>This is mine. With that face.</p>

        <p>With that facial expression.</p>

        <p>So Lumiere's mood was much better. If Eustaf hadn't kept himself in check at all, he would have felt rather bad.</p>

        <p>"Eus? I can’t breath."</p>

        <p>Ran struggled in the hug, and only then did Eustaf let her go.</p>

        <p>Ran looked back and laughed.</p>

        <p>"Lumiere has a clean cut of hair."</p>

        <p>"Is it nice to see?"</p>

        <p>"Yes."</p>

        <p>"If master like it, I like it, too."</p>

        <p>"I'm telling you,"</p>

        <p>Ran said with a smile, "I can't help it."</p>

        <p>'I hope Lumiere gets psychological independence from me, too.'</p>

        <p>It won't work out when Lily gets back.</p>

        <p>Ran thought so and said,</p>

        <p>"Ah!"</p>

        <p>"Eus, take Lumiere with you."</p>

        <p>Then the two men replied at the same time.</p>

        <p>"No."</p>

        <p>"No."</p>

        <p>Then they looked at each other and saw Ran who was embarrassed.</p>

        <p>"No, Lumiere was also strong····· . I think it would be better to be escorted by an escort, and I know Lord Ross is strong-."</p>

        <p>Ran thought that Lumiere would be stronger in response to the situation. Eustaf said.</p>

        <p>"I'd rather be by your side than Lumiere."</p>

        <p>He said so and peeked out and said.</p>

        <p>"I think I'll have to go right away. Please stay still until I come back."</p>

        <p>Ran shrugged her shoulders and Eustaf looked at her until she answered,</p>

        <p>"Okay."</p>

        <p>Ran saw Eustaf off and Ran was lost in thought for a while.</p>

        <p>'How will the Emperor come out?'</p>

        <p>I sighed that my head rolled only on the bad side.</p>

        <p>******</p>

        <p>Ruth was in a state of anger until the end of his head. It was hot inside the palace.</p>

        <p>In the past, fan would have cooled off this heat, but the swelling felt stuffy to those who tasted the cold air.</p>

        <p>'I won't give you ice crystals!'</p>

        <p>Growing up, Ruth told him to force him to steal the crystal from the Golden Rose.</p>

        <p>The captain expressed disapproval. You can't do that kind of looting.</p>

        <p>No, it's the Emperor's order, but why not?</p>

        <p>Isn't everything in this empire mine?</p>

        <p>I heard that ice crystals were falling through the servant and Olivia, but it was really going to happen and passed it to one ear. However, due to the lack of ice crystals, they were unable to light candles, blow wind with fans, and even spread the stately rainbow wings on horse pulling wagons.</p>

        <p>'I'll show you the bitter taste.'</p>

        <p>Ruth gritted his teeth thinking so.</p>
