                <p data-p-id="72b6c2b9d3f0c9e2055ee9c828d2beca">Eustaf put down the glass and said, "For now, it's between she and me. And." Eustaf said casually.<br><br>"Not getting approval doesn't mean Lazia isn't Lazia."<br><br>Olivia flinched at the arrogant words. She quickly covered her face with laughter.<br><br>"You're saying something scary, Duke. Could it be treason?"<br><br>"Is that so?"
<br>Eustaf said so and got up from his seat. It was rude not to ask her to leave.<br><br>"Then I'm going to get going….to the Empress Dowager, I will listen to her opinion."
<br><br>He left after saying so and greeting lightly. Olivia's face hardened when he left.<br><br>Heung!<br><br>She snorted and leaned against the chair. 'Okay, let's see how much I can do with my power.' She smeared her mouth.<br><br>Eustaf looked up at the sky as he left the palace. Before I knew it, the sun was going down. Along with the carriage, Ross came up and made a grim face.<br><br>"He wasn’t here again today?"<br><br>"I heard he went to play with the baroness."<br><br>Ross's face turned red when Eustaf said nothing.
<br>He was so angry that he couldn't even speak. A few times he murmured, 'Shit!' 'Oh!' he said.<br><br>"He's going to keep coming out like this, isn't he? So what is he gonna do?"<br><br>"So, what is he going to do?"
<br>Eustaf thought so and said, pulling on his Cravat and loosening it.<br><br>"It's already getting hot."<br><br>"Because summer in the capital city is fast."<br><br>"Yes, it is."
<br>Eustaf said so and smiled coldly.<br><br>"Have you looked around the palace?"<br><br>"Huh?"
<br>Ross blinked at the sudden question. Did you look around the palace?<br><br>Eustaf said as he got on the wagon.
<br>"He's using a lot of magic tricks."<br><br>******<br><br>Lumiere looked around, avoiding blood splashing. I could see Blaine getting rid of the last one.
<br>Lumiere said in a relaxed tone.<br><br>"Who are they? The attackers."
<br>Blaine said with a frightening look on his face, kicking the body.<br><br>"I should have kept one alive."<br><br>"I would have killed myself."
<br>Lumiere said so and began to rummage around the body of the missing body.<br><br>"There's nothing to tell we exactly who is he. What a midnight raid. Besides, how did he know we were staying here tonight?"
<br>Blaine groaned and said.<br><br>"The itinerary of Ms Ran's tour is known to everyone."<br><br>"Oh, my."<br><br>"This is not gonna happen-"<br><br>"She wouldn't have thought about it. Me, too. In Lazia, you're a person who's praised, aren't you?"<br><br>Whether he was being sarcastic or not, he took a glass bottle out of the body's pocket. There was something liquid inside.<br><br>"It's an expensive glass bottle and an unidentified drug."<br><br>He opened the lid on, Lumiere smelled it, frowned and closed the lid back. He said, throwing it to Blaine.<br><br>"It’s sleep pills."<br><br>"Sleep pills?"<br><br>"It's a kind of anesthetic. Was the purpose of the kidnapping?"<br><br>"Is that so?"
<br>Blaine had a puzzled face. He was also guilty of kidnapping the aristocrat. Lumiere said, undressing the body.
<br><br>"Maybe he was confident that he would kill everyone and kidnap them because we brought out a small number of people. They were actually quite talented."<br><br>Blaine frowned as he watched Lumiere undress.<br><br>"So you've been attacking five or six people?"<br><br>"I didn't think it would be this easy to spot."<br><br>Blaine flinched and sighed at Lumiere's words. Obviously, it might be.<br><br>"And I don't think all he had was sleeping pills."<br><br>Blaine and Lumiere looked back because they heard a woman's voice from behind. Dimodia approached him with an irritated face and offered Blaine a bunch of cotton t balls.<br><br>"I heard this was installed onhe stove."<br><br>"Scent?"<br><br>"It's a sleeping scent. If you had smoked the stove without knowing, everyone would have drank it and boiled it down."<br><br>Dimodia's words hardened Blaine's face. Lumiere looked at the naked body and said.<br><br>"They're definitely trained. A guild of assassins?"<br><br>Lumiere mumbled and wondered if they were connected to his past. But the worry quickly disappeared. However, they are not brave enough to kidnap the count.<br><br>"Master?"<br><br>Dimodia laughed at Lumiere's words.
<br>"Lady, she's sleeping well. She must have been tired."     <span class="comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal">

<br>"She must be tired."<br><br>And Dimodia said,
<br>"Both of you go first. I'll clean this up."<br><br>Blaine asked, "Alone?" and quickly corrected himself.<br><br>"All right."
<br>Lumiere also shook his hand and got up from his seat. When the two disappeared into the mansion, Dimodia looked back, and The Viridescent Shadow began to show one or two images in the dark.<br><br>"Is there anything else besides them?"<br><br>One of The Viridescent Shadow answered Dimodia's question.
<br>"One or two."<br><br>"Is he alive?"<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>Dimodia smiled bloody.
<br>"Then we can take the body with us and study it."<br><br>At her words, The Viridescent Shadow put the body in a sack without saying a word and began to clean up the bloodstains.
<br>Dimodia was lost in thought, tapping her lips.<br><br>The Viridescent Shadow has a long history.
<br>Blue flame and greening.
<br>The history of these two began with the beginning of Lazia. It is a little later that The Viridescent Shadow on the back was formed than the front blue flame knights.
<br>Originally, the name was greening, but later changed to The Viridescent Shadow.<br><br>In the early days when the name was "Greening," it was said to be a group belonging to the Duchess.
<br>Since then, the duke took direct command and renamed it The Viridescent Shadow. As it is a historic group, The Viridescent Shadow was proud of themselves.<br><br>'He's got that kind of ability.'     <span class="comment-marker hide-marker on-inline-comments-modal">

</p><p data-p-id="b0aed495b5921028e7d9d78ff2a6fee8">Dimodia smiled coldly.
<br>"Whoever it is, you'll regret having a fight."<br><br>******<br><br>Ran fell asleep at the sound of a humming on the second morning. When I woke up, Dimodia smiled and said hello.<br><br>"Are you awake?"<br><br>"Yes..."
<br>Mumbling with a yawn, Ran saw Dimodia. Whatever it was, Dimodia looked as excited as she could.<br><br>'Is it because it's the day we go back?'<br><br>Even if it's The Viridescent Shadow, they make us follow the maid to this place. It must be hard.
<br>Ran smiled and said to her with a feeling of sorry.<br><br>"I'll give you a vacation when you get back to the castle. I think only Dia is having a hard time."<br><br>At her words, Dimodia laughed, "Oh my?"<br><br>"It's my pleasure to work for you. Come on, get up. The weather is nice today."<br><br>Ran stretched out her legs.
<br>I approached the window and opened the window, and there was a really pleasant spring breeze. It was spring in Lazia, too.<br><br>'Today is the day I will go home!' Ran is excited.<br><br>******<br><br>Bam!<br><br>The low table fell with a loud noise. Ruth huffed out.
<br>"Fail? Do you know how much money I've given to you guys? Huh?!!"<br><br>"I'm sorry."<br><br>He approached his flat opponent, and Ruth kicked him wildly. His personality, which had been a complacent since the crown prince, blossomed more when he became the emperor.<br><br>"I didn't say anything difficult! It's so hard to bring a weak woman!"<br><br>Ruth's eyes were glistening. As he kicked and huffed a few more times, his favorite, Cortizan Sarah, approached Ruth’s arm.<br><br>"Your Majesty, relax, okay? You'll have another chance." She knew how to please him like a whore.<br><br>"I'm sure he knew your majesty from this. Don't that right?"<br><br>When I saw Sarah shaking her nose, Ruth was relieved. It always feels good to know his greatness.
