        <p>Cyrus threw his tongue out at the amazing nerve, wondering, "Was it real?"</p>

        <p>"You must not rush into the palace a mineral of unidentified mana from an unauthorized estate, not a to duke."</p>

        <p>Eustaf said so and buried himself deep in the chair.</p>

        <p>"Isn't that right?"</p>

        <p>"That's right."</p>

        <p>Cyrus responded and briefly thought about how crazy the imperial family would be. It's frustrating to imagine a life without ice crystals-And it's social season.</p>

        <p>A ball is being held at the palace, and you can't use any magic crafts?</p>

        <p>I almost knew what it would look like.</p>

        <p>'Cause if you do something wrong, it could be an all-out war against the imperial family.'</p>

        <p>Do you think the emperor will bow down?</p>

        <p>Cyrus thought of Ruth. Everyone already knew how terrible he was when he became the emperor.</p>

        <p>Also, about how much the great empress must suffer. Cyrus spoke low.</p>

        <p>"The Emperor's death."</p>

        <p>Eustaf looked up and looked at Cyrus.</p>

        <p>"Is it natural death?"</p>

        <p>Elise flinched. She managed to hold back from almost shouting</p>

        <p>'Honey!' without realizing it.</p>

        <p>Eustaf's expression was erased from his face. He chose a word.</p>

        <p>"He was an upright man."</p>

        <p>"Yes, but that's how it goes in the morning?"</p>

        <p>"Death is fair to all."</p>

        <p>"Of course, but…"</p>

        <p>Cyrus frowned. Just in time, behind the party, there was a light tap on the tree, and the servant came up with the tea set, lined up a set of tea on the table, and stepped back.</p>

        <p>Eustaf took a sip of cold tea and said,</p>

        <p>"But I agree."</p>

        <p>Elise opened her eyes wide. She cleared her voice and spoke cheerfully.</p>

        <p>"You used to tell me something bloody, and you two are telling me a really scary story in this place."</p>

        <p>Cyrus smiled and wrapped her shoulders and kissed her on the cheek.</p>

        <p>"If you're afraid, my wife, I'll quit."</p>

        <p>"Please do."</p>

        <p>Elise smeared her cheek.</p>

        <p>After that, the three of them didn't bring it up, and the conversation went on to a normal topic.</p>

        <p>Eustaf was offended by the malicious rumors that Elise had told him about Ran.</p>

        <p>The people who did not know Ran's future were told that</p>

        <p>Ran had been erased from the Lazian line of succession, and they exaggerated all kinds of imaginations and told bad stories about Ran.</p>

        <p>"And there's also a lot of rumors about who Eustaf is going to marry. First of all, the biggest candidate is young lady, Duke of Usla. And the Marquis of Namia."</p>

        <p>Eustaf's mouth was filled with arsenic smile.</p>

        <p>"I've been invited several times. She seemed to be persistent somehow, but was there a rumor like that?"</p>

        <p>"Yes, young, rich, even Lazia? Of course, she hates winter, but it's a problem that's solved when she's in the green arch."</p>

        <p>It was an irrelevant but legitimate assessment.</p>

        <p>"I'm not thinking that way."</p>

        <p>"That's what young men do."</p>

        <p>Elise secretly looked over at him, saying so.</p>

        <p>Eustaf added words to her gaze.</p>

        <p>"Because I already have someone else, I like."</p>

        <p>The words drew a thick line around Elise's mouth.</p>

        <p>"I won't ask who it is."</p>

        <p>"Thank you for that."</p>

        <p>Eustaf replied, and Cyrus muttered,</p>

        <p>"I'm curious…" He was stabbed in the ribs by his wife.</p>

        <p>After such a light tea time, Eustaf returned to the green arch.</p>

        <p>Of course, I thought Marquis Cyrus and his wife would come back together, but the two fell into it because there was something else going on. It was rude enough, but Eustaf didn't say much because that's what he's already done without a word.</p>

        <p>To be honest, I didn't even hate that look. When I returned to the green arch, the atmosphere of the mansion was bright.</p>

        <p>'Is it because I'm not here?'</p>

        <p>With that thought, Eustaf took off his jacket to the smiling Rolf.</p>

        <p>"Have you heard from the Sky castle?"</p>

        <p>When asked by Eustaf, Rolf wiped his laughter and said,</p>

        <p>"Not yet."</p>

        <p>Eustaf unknowingly poked his forehead. It was a long time ago that he sent the letter. Originally, it was time for Ran to answer.</p>

        <p>No matter how muddy the road is, it's so late.</p>

        <p>'Are you angry?'</p>

        <p>Because I sent the letter too late?</p>

        <p>Thinking so, I felt a little nervous, so Eustaf sighed and sat on the sofa. I didn't mean to hide it from Ran. I just didn't know what to write.</p>

        <p>There were a lot of letters that he threw away while writing. Eustaf first found it so hard to write a letter.</p>

        <p>After all, what he sent was a report-like letter that only listed the case. All he could do was add,</p>

        <p>"I want to see her as a P.S."</p>

        <p>'But Ran doesn't know unless I speak candidly.'</p>

        <p>But it didn't seem to mean that I failed while writing a letter. Then someone covered his eyes from behind.</p>

        <p>"Who is this-?"</p>

        <p>At the cheerful question, Eustaf was so surprised that he was stiff at the moment. Stuttering his hand that covered his eyes, Eustaf grabbed the wrist and muttered.</p>

        <p>"Ran······?"</p>

        <p>When Ran was called "Ran," not "Noonim," her face turned a little red without realizing it. It was a very soft and sweet 'Ran'. She pretended to be calm and let go of her hand and laughed.</p>

        <p>"That's correct."</p>

        <p>"How are you here-"</p>

        <p>"You said you missed me? That's why I came running."</p>

        <p>Ran said, as she was going to laugh and walk away, but Eustaf didn't let go of her wrist.</p>

        <p>"Eus, if you don't let me go, I can't get back on the couch."</p>

        <p>At the words, Eustaf let go of her hand and quickly pulled her around the armrest as soon as she turned.</p>

        <p>"Eustaf."</p>

        <p>She frowned and made a stern face, but Ran made eye contact with him, her eyes shook without realizing it.</p>

        <p>"I missed you."</p>

        <p>Ran coughed and looked up again at the tickling voice above her head.</p>

        <p>"That's why I'm here. Why on earth did you send the letter so late?"</p>

        <p>"There are many things that have happened..."</p>

        <p>Mumbling, Eustaf frowned slightly. It was because he thought that his work with Ruth had not yet been completed.</p>

        <p>"I didn't expect you to come like this."</p>

        <p>"Of course, Eustaf asked for Lazia, but I thought it would be okay to come at this point, because the main things in the spring are over. Everyone agreed."</p>

        <p>"Is that so?"</p>

        <p>When his answer was ambiguous, Ran turned sour without realizing it.</p>

        <p>"Is it good that I'm here? You don't like it?"</p>

        <p>Eustaf laughed at Ran's words.</p>

        <p>"I can't hate it."</p>

        <p>The words soon lifted Ran's spirits.</p>

        <p>He asked.</p>

        <p>"Then the Marquis Cyrus and his wife came today..."</p>

        <p>"I asked Lizzie to do it. I want you to go outside for a second. In the meantime, they rushed in."</p>

        <p>Eustaf whispered in her words.</p>

        <p>"I really can't defeat Ran."</p>

        <p>"Are you going to win?"</p>

        <p>When Ran blinked her eyes with an innocent face, Eustaf leaned down and kissed her on the forehead, saying,</p>

        <p>"No way."</p>

        <p>Lan blushed, but she stood up pretending not to say anything.</p>

        <p>"Ice modification to the palace has stopped. It's about time we ran out of stock. According to Levery, the imperial protest is enormous."</p>

        <p>"That's what we want. And they'd been monopolizing it for another year, so I'll have to listen to this." Ran nodded at the words.
