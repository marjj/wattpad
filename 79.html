<p>The answer came straight out without any hesitation. There is no such thing as loyalty to this guild. Then, a woman's voice came from above his head.</p>

<p>"I think he's right. Because the Guild Master said the same thing."</p>

<p>"Then, Second. Has the request changed from kidnapping to murder?"</p>

<p>At the words, Poakin swallowed his saliva and replied, "Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't think your guild has that much talent, who did you ask to kill?"</p>

<p>"That, that's--"</p>

<p>When he was speechless, the second one kicked him in the face without mercy.</p>

<p>"Arghh!"</p>

<p>The second said, stepping down on his short screaming back.</p>

<p>"I want you to answer the screams in time. I don't want my boots to get dirty."</p>

<p>"I, I, have commissioned from Sidra."</p>

<p>And he began to cry pitifully. It was a cry, not a thought to be the right arm of the Killer Guild, who had grown old enough.</p>

<p>In the later world, Sidra was also famous for being a cruel man.</p>

<p>If it is known that he has revealed it, he will not survive even if he lives here now.</p>

<p>"That's right with the guild leader."</p>

<p>"All right"</p>

<p>When the boots turned around and started walking, Poakin thought he lived. But it was a short time, and soon his head rolled on the floor.</p>

<p>The second smiled.</p>

<p>"You killed as many people as you could for money."</p>

<p>Did you think you'd survive if you only said that much?</p>

<p>"It's a tongue"</p>

<p>The second said, laughed, and quickly followed Eustaf. As I came out of the hallway, I noticed the The Viridescent Shadow standing side by side.</p>

<p>"You know what to do."</p>

<p>When Eustaf said, the second bowed as if she were flying.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Eustaf glanced at the second and left the underground house. Soon the fire soared from the house. People tried to put out the fire, but it didn't go out. Fortunately, it didn't burn around, so the damage was only to the people in the house.</p>

<p>******</p>

<p>Olivia bit her fingertips.</p>

<p>'That cheeky little girl!'</p>

<p>Anger flared up.</p>

<p>Empress Katya, who had been pushed to the back room, was active again. It was natural that it didn't help her.</p>

<p>It was obvious to anyone with one eye that Countess Ran Romia was at the center of the work.</p>

<p>After the accident at Count Lieselotti's house, the Empress brought Ran to the palace to console her, and she held a full-fledged tea party starting with it.</p>

<p>It was not only women but also young men that Ran strongly targeted. It was because I realized something when I saw Countess Lieselotti's banquet.</p>

<p>As rumors spread that good men gathered at the banquet held by the Empress, of course, more women attended.</p>

<p>It was a voluntary operation to bring the women on Olivia's side because it was difficult to lure them one by one.</p>

<p>Olivia was furious. People who had to come to themselves and hang on now went to Empress Katya and started hanging on. Even in the name of an imperial adult, Olivia's position was further reduced, as the words of Empress Katya worked well in the palace.</p>

<p>'What should I do?'</p>

<p>While agonizing, Olivia smiled.</p>

<p>'Yes, you don't have to be an enemy, do you?'</p>

<p>It would be best if I could get you on my side. And after Ran gets close enough to herself.</p>

<p>'Isn't betrayal supposed to be on my side?'</p>

<p>Thinking so, Olivia giggled.</p>

<p>******</p>

<p>Lumiere really stuck like a gum and didn't fall since Ran was attacked.</p>

<p>'And I think he's getting better and better and better.'</p>

<p>Ran was troubled by Lumiere, who handed over a handkerchief or fan she had forgotten.</p>

<p>I know you're determined not to leave your seat next to me-</p>

<p>'But you can't do it like this.'</p>

<p>When do you train and when do you practice swordsmanship?</p>

<p>"Do you need anything else?"</p>

<p>"No, it's okay."</p>

<p>In response, Ran unfolded her fan and showed it to the people sitting together on the table. Kartya Empress was amazed.</p>

<p>"Pretty. Is it made of a piece of shell?"</p>

<p>"It looks like a rainbow."</p>

<p>The Duchess of Usla, who has now become very friendly, praised her.</p>

<p>"You look like your master in many colors."</p>

<p>Everyone burst into laughter at the words of the Duchess of Usla.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, Master so sweet, too."</p>

<p>"This is embarrassing for the day."</p>

<p>Some people put in a chuimse. Ran was amazing, but she didn't lose her smile and answered.</p>

<p>"Maybe that's why Eustaf gave it to me as a gift."</p>

<p>This kind of work continued even after it was publicly revealed that she and Eustaf were lovers.</p>

<p>'Maybe it's because it doesn't have the same form as Liz.'</p>

<p>Young Master Usla, now in front of him, was also the third son of the Duke of Usla. The Duchess of Usla secretly poked at Ran, saying he was her son and could not give him a title when he
<p>married, but his dowry would be enormous.</p>

<p>'The lives of men under the eldest son who don’t have a title in the Empire are tiring.'</p>

<p>Ran thought so and used to ignore the courtship that flocked to her.</p>

<p>"Did the Duke of Lazia give you as present?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, he gave you this gift. The Duke of Lazia is different."</p>

<p>The women soon spoke in unison.</p>

<p>When holding a banquet or tea party, Ran put a lot of effort into interior and props and atmosphere.</p>

<p>It adds a modern feeling, but it mixes only 10 to 20% of the time, and the atmosphere itself is light, fluffy, and the place where puns and plays come and go.</p>

<p>Readings, observe artifacts from afar, draw ridiculous pictures to match--</p>

<p>With games that might have been played on the MT, the gathering of Empress Katya quickly soared to the peak of popularity. A secret request was also received from Empress Katya, who also spoke
<p>to Ruth, the emperor.</p>

<p>Ruth was also weak with his mother, so his words were eaten by the emperor, and Empress Katya's position became firm.</p>

<p>'When this happened, they took away all the power of Islam, Qing and Empress Dowager and made them go to the back room.'</p>

<p>Ran thought so and put the orange sherbet in her mouth. The fresh and sweet sherbet melted in her mouth in an instant. These foods also came up with the idea of Ran.</p>

<p>'It's annoying, but definitely the empress's position has decreased.'</p>

<p>That's what the Empress is without children.</p>

<p>Even these days, Empress Katya says, 'I think Olivia is really stone me. Perhaps we should select an old and new empress,' she said secretly to Ran.</p>

<p>Then she sent a meaningful look, and Ran managed to hold back the words, "I never marry a son of a dog."</p>

<p>'There's no more bullying in society.'</p>

<p>Elise grumbled, "Oh, my God, people who used to gossip about Ran are now praising her," but Ran thought it was okay.</p>

<p>A person who changes his position according to public opinion is not a difficult opponent. But the problem is people who keep cursing.</p>

<p>Wouldn't negative stalking be the scariest thing?</p>

<p>After the short tea party, everyone said, "I wish there were more." I left with a sense of regret.</p>

<p>The time limit was also Ran's idea.</p>

<p>If you want to come back again.</p>

<p>In addition, too loose gatherings easily gain a reputation for boredom.</p>

<p>While coming out of the white palace where Empress Kartya was staying, the maid approached and tightened her head.</p>

<p>"I see Countess Romia."</p>

<p>Bowing down, she added.</p>

<p>"The Empress wants to see you."</p>

<p>Ran opened her lips slightly and said with a big smile. "Thank God, but I'm going home because I'm not feeling well. I'm afraid I'll bother her, so tell her I'll come to her officially later."</p>

<p>Ran reviewed what she said and thought there was no problem, so she told the maid, "Go ahead," and left the palace.</p>

<p>Riding in the carriage, Ran said.</p>

<p>"What kind of publicity?"</p>

<p>"Maybe she's trying to mix it with master's popularity."</p>

<p>At Lumiere's words, Ran murmured, "If you're such a simple person…" she looked at Lumiere.</p>

<p>"Lumiere."</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking."</p>

<p>As her face became serious, so did his face. He was getting used to the power struggle in the palace.</p>

<p>But I always feel that I'm lacking.</p>

<p>Ran opened her mouth.</p>

<p>"I don't think Lumiere should escort me anymore." In an unexpected shock, Lumiere was speechless.</p>

<p>"Lumiere, I like you." Ran spoke frankly.</p>

<p>"But I don't think Lumiere should stick with me like this all day."</p>

<p>"Is that what the guy who was attacked a while ago would say?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I need an escort-"</p>

<p>Ran paused for a moment and said,</p>

<p>"That doesn't have to be Lumiere."</p>

<p>Lumiere stared blankly at Ran. His pretty scarlet eyes trembled, so Ran reached out without realizing it, overlapped on his hand, and was held tight.</p>

<p>"What don't you like?"</p>

<p>However, unlike the power of the grip, Lumiere's tone was soft and soft. The smile on his face became thicker.</p>

<p>"If there's anything you don't like, I'll fix it, tell me what you want. What? The swordsmanship training can be done in the evening, and I'll take turns."</p>

<p>"Lumiere"</p>

<p>"Or do you want anything else? I know I'm not good enough, so-"</p>

<p>"Lumiere"</p>

<p>Ran called his name again.</p>

<p>"It's alright."</p>

<p>She said so and smiled.</p>

<p>"It's not about changing Lumiere, it's not about lack, it's not about that. I mean, it's not that-"</p>

<p>"You don't need me anymore."</p>

<p>"Uh-"</p>

<p>"It's kind of a mess, it's good to be kind after you get it, but you're thinking that it's going to get in the way of your love affair with the Duke."</p>

<p>Ran's emerald-colored eyes blinked a couple of times.</p>

<p>Lumiere spit out his words and couldn't stand it himself.</p>

<p>The feeling of being naked, but I can't stand it without spitting it out.</p>

<p>So, the word accelerated more and more.</p>

<p>"No, I'm a man of unknown identity, and I've known that favor and whim and whim. So, I tried to please him a little bit, and he acted like a dog, but I guess he doesn't like that. Oh, so what
<p>happens to Lily? Are you going to sell me somewhere else? I wish I could get a high price."</p>

<p>As the words got longer, the sarcasm grew longer, and even if I knew that I was running toward breakdown, I couldn't pick up the words I had already said.</p>

<p>I think I'm getting quieter and deeper into the dark.</p>

<p>Lumiere did not look away from Ran. Whether it's contempt, sympathy, or whatever appears on her face, it's likely to fall apart.</p>

<p>But Ran looked at Lumiere and said,</p>

<p>"Lumiere. It's a self-pity, right?"</p>

<p>He said, as he was surprised. Lumiere looked blankly at Ran.</p>

<p>Ran said he was embarrassed.</p>

<p>"No, I never thought you'd be thinking that. That can't be right. No, I'm not that kind of person."</p>

<p>She frowned and pulled him on the cheek.</p>

<p>It was exactly what I did to Eustaf a long time ago, so Lumiere somehow felt itchy.</p>

<p>"I told you, I like Lumiere. Of course, I know that when a person is depressed, he doesn't hear good things and only bad things, but that's, but that's not true." Ran laughed like that.</p>

<p>"I really can't. Lumiere, it's true that I saved Lumiere. But I don't want to limit Lumiere's world to me."</p>

<p>"No!'</p>

<p>"Lumiere wants to be restrained?"</p>

<p>Speaking as if he knew what to say in advance, Ran smiled.</p>

<p>"Think about it after you're not restricted."</p>

<p>"Master-"</p>

<p>"I'm the owner of Lumiere, right?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Then you'll do what I tell you to do, right?"</p>

<p>Ran's green eyes had a strange feeling. It's not just a jewel, it's-</p>

<p>'It's transparent and you're likely to see the floor....' And this side looks like you can see the floor.</p>

<p>"Respect."</p>

<p>Lumiere answered so with his head down, and Ran moved to his side and flopped down.</p>

<p>"It's a relief though."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Lumiere talks in his heart."</p>

<p>Only then did his face show signs of embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't mean it all."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. But what do you think? Doesn't it feel cool talking to me?"</p>

<p>Lumiere laughed bitterly at Ran's words. He told such a story to himself and was refuted head-on, so it couldn't have been cool.</p>

<p>I felt like the darkness in my heart fell out at once.</p>

<p>"I mean, I have high hopes for Lumiere."</p>

<p>"High expectations?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I mean-"</p>

<p>Ran thought about what to say and said, "Ah."</p>

<p>"The ability to knock down a large number of big one?"</p>

<p>"I see"</p>

<p>Ran spoke easily because he didn't even know how big it was, and Lumiere took it seriously.</p>

<p>"That's definitely going to happen to Lumiere. I know."</p>

<p>Lumiere looked at Ran's side face. Ran turned her head and said, facing his eyes.</p>

<p>"But even if it doesn't happen, it doesn't change that I like Lumiere."</p>

<p>"Master."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"Do you know I like you?"
