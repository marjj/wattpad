    <p>Lazia had a long winter, so food shortages were chronic. Last year, I bought a large amount of food with money and distributed it, and as soon as spring came, I started lending food.
    <p>'I know that you shouldn't give it to me for free ·····.'</p>
    <p>Instead, interest rates are set at·····</p>
    <p>Eustaf had removed loan sharks like an ant with his fingers, and Ran thought, 'That, that much?' but he seemed to have been a bad guy and a hook that was not comparable to a modern private loaner.</p>
    <p>Even Elizabeth was saying that she was relieved.</p>
    <p>'If you think about it, isn't that the same thing for Lumiere?'</p>
    <p>In a world where there's a possibility of being sold as a slave, a loan shark is a huge thing.</p>
    <p>Anyway, it wasn't too fancy, but I dressed up in fancy clothes and went on a tour.</p>
    <p>On each way out, the territorial people came out and shouted "Long live Lazia!" and Ran banned it from being unbearable.</p>
    <p>"How are you? Did you deserve this winter?"</p>
    <p>When asked by Ran, the farmer answered with a restless look.</p>
    <p>"Yes, of course! Thanks to you, I spent the winter without freezing anyone to death."</p>
    <p>"Didn't you run out of ice or something?"</p>
    <p>"That was enough."</p>
    <p>"Good thing."</p>
    <p>Ran smiled with a smile.
    <p>She said.</p>
    <p>"Tell me if you need anything else. I'll petition the Duke." Then suddenly the farmer burst into tears.</p>
    <p>"No, even this is enough. If I want more, I'm greedy."</p>
    <p>Then he cried and Ran was really embarrassed, and the manager in the middle soothed him and said.</p>
    <p>"I'm thrilled that such a high man has heard the story." No, it's like a great companion·······?</p>
    <p>Ran thought so, and said, "Are you saying something unreasonable?</p>
    <p>"We're not being forced to do this?" he asked, and the farmer fell flat on his face.</p>
    <p>"No!! Really, it's been so long since I've had such an abundant winter - and you've been so kind to a man like me·····!"</p>
    <p>Ran was embarrassed, but she tried to remain calm and said, as she was impressed.</p>
    <p>"I'm glad I did. If there's anything uncomfortable in the future, please feel free to tell me."</p>
    <p>Then she quickly left with her party.</p>
    <p>Riding on the horse, she left there and whispered to Lumiere, who ran side by side.</p>
    <p>"I'm so surprised."</p>
    <p>"Is that so?"</p>
    <p>Lumiere blinked his eyes. He understood the farmer's mind too well.
    <p>"Maybe someone threatened me or asked me to compliment you?"
    <p>She frowned and asked seriously, so he smiled quietly.
    <p>"I don't think so. Whenever I think of my master, I cry." Lan opened her eyes wide and burst into laughter.</p>
    <p>"Okay, okay, okay."</p>
    <p>Ran said so and looked around.
    <p>Everyone is wearing old and shabby clothes, but they didn't look bad.
    <p>'I'm gonna have to do a dark trip later.'</p>
    <p>I don't think the king sent a secret agent or a secret agent for no reason.</p>
    <p>Ran shook her head excitedly thinking so. If I could, I'd like to go on a tour from the end of the estate to the end, but it seemed difficult.</p>
    <p>I'd like to take a look around the home of the deities myself but-</p>
    <p>'I can't do that.'</p>
    <p>Everyone seemed to be quite happy that the duke, Eustaf, toured in person. But Ran, the count, had no authority. Even if you're a general or a patriarch, that's crossing the line.</p>
    <p>'A duchess wouldn't know.'</p>
    <p>When I thought about it, Ran felt her cheeks turning red. She ran faster, consciously trying to shake the idea off.</p>
    <p>"Then the patrol is almost over."</p>
    <p>Blaine, who followed her from behind, nodded at her words.</p>
    <p>"That's right. I'll stay outside until today, and I'll go back to the Sky castle tomorrow."</p>
    <p>"Oh, we're finally leaving."</p>
    <p>I smiled thinking that the sky castle has become a complete sense of "my house."</p>
    <p>"Before that, I'll stay at the villa today." Blaine added, saying so.</p>
    <p>"And you didn't have to come out like this."</p>
    <p>Ran opened her eyes wide and smiled slightly at the words, and Blaine hurriedly added.</p>
    <p>"Of course, I'm not saying anything, but it's hard to go on an outside tour."</p>
    <p>"I know, but Eus- No, Lord want to keep it at its best because it's left to you."</p>
    <p>She grinned as she said so. Blaine looked at her for a moment. There was a story that Eustaf gathered and told separately.</p>
    <p>"I proposed to Ran."</p>
    <p>Everyone blinked because it sounded as if they were eating bread today.</p>
    <p>Then it was his father, Baron Wilde, who rose from his seat like a tingling.</p>
    <p>"You'll marry the Count Romia?!"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>Then the Count of Illuminati asked slowly.</p>
    <p>"So did you succeed?"</p>
    <p>"No."</p>
    <p>Rarely, Eustaf spoke with a bitter smile and asked sharply.</p>
    <p>"I think you already knew."</p>
    <p>"I heard from Ms. Lan."</p>
    <p>"Is that so?"</p>
    <p>Eustaf's blue eyes glanced at him, and the Count of</p>
    <p>Illuminati replied briefly, "I didn't object."</p>
    <p>The atmosphere between the people who went after Eustaf said so was different, but everyone felt "It's okay?" in common.</p>
    <p>Elisabeth later said, "Are you marrying for profit, even though you don't like Ran?" but Blaine didn't think so.</p>
    <p>'Anyway, she said no.'</p>
    <p>Blaine thought so, and when he looked at Ran, Ran asked.</p>
    <p>"Is there something on my face?"</p>
    <p>"No, it's nothing."</p>
    <p>In a hurry, Blaine turned his head.</p>
    <p>Ran blinked and said, wondering.</p>
    <p>"You're in a villa today?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, the Lazian houses and villas that we built before exist here and there. There's a lot of bad management - it's a good place today."</p>
    <p>"I see."
    <p>Ran nodded.</p>
    <p>This tour was also a week ago. Running on a muddy road was harder than running a horse, so Ran was riding, so the moment she got off the horse and threw herself into bed in the evening was always happy.</p>
    <p>"I hope we get there soon." Ran said so and grinned.</p>
