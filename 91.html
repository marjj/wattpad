<p data-p-id="1d17e7c22d9f91c4c8a571df38ecdc5e">Walking on the terrace, Lan trembled lightly in the cold.

</p><p data-p-id="21ddd13becf1e006398cd468f2b164c8">'Like the prince's fiancee in front of Cinderella.'

</p><p data-p-id="da68044b5ac3ca55bd31eb438b30becf">Lan grinned.

</p><p data-p-id="14cce1dfdf6a1db1e993508c29fb0041">She fell into Cinderella's book and became the prince's fiancee, when the ball finally opened and Cinderella, who was covered with ashes, appeared with the help of a wizard.

</p><p data-p-id="9430459132aa15f422acba48f6b2d752">'This is what it's like.'

</p><p data-p-id="26d370dda55cab29ad0148cc7fc1fde5">Lan pressed her eyes, thinking so.

</p><p data-p-id="ceaf23c798d0b37db3b2b4313514d206">Even though you think you're doing the stupidest and most painful thing in the world, you can't stop.

</p><p data-p-id="f8b9845974b4ead05121a0b1f8c60ba9">Stopping on the terrace, she realized with a sigh.

</p><p data-p-id="9a417714f830f751c1946de7d1e69f0b">'I really love Youth a lot.'

</p><p data-p-id="5888ccf06af2ba92a7ef65cb8437f90a">If her own life was at stake, she would never have said such things as handing over Eustaf to Sina or following her fate.

</p><p data-p-id="fe11735333af73e4cd781a4838e02a97">But if Eustaf's life is at stake.

</p><p data-p-id="599d0e7831052ca99ce19ef14f5fed12">Then the story changes.

</p><p data-p-id="10505d4bbcf7f363d597b9aaf8192198">'That's why love creates weaknesses.'

</p><p data-p-id="5fb939c7ed04c5544959f6008896dcf0">Lan laughed bitterly thinking so.

</p><p data-p-id="ed13ffbfb670ef724453d7c3eebbc14a">As long as Eustaf is safe and happy, I'm fine.

</p><p data-p-id="6208f19017a1832e389c53473f20e17a">Because I love Youth.

</p><p data-p-id="ae5ed43a3738a55f73f1310ff9b93e12">But to love so much, it's painful like this.

</p><p data-p-id="e3c15de6830039d845b1438d0034d1be">'Should I start going in? Or should I spend more time.'

</p><p data-p-id="4d56682d76ca56a7eac5789fd739e8f9">However, even if you're too cold, you'd better go in somewhere because they'll think you're weird.

</p><p data-p-id="ddf55c8aa9c7e468f718c5e504ecef80">'I'm gonna rob the liquor cabinet.'

</p><p data-p-id="1af9def10d35bada05b9614437ccf004">Lan grinned and went inside with such thoughts.

</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******

</p><p data-p-id="07cce657df6b73293f7f6663ff5243b4">Sina noticed that Eustaf was slowly getting uncomfortable. I have a cold sweat on my back.

</p><p data-p-id="cf835ee6c0e2616d0e8564769fffa1b2">'Ran Unnie, why aren't you coming?'

</p><p data-p-id="e34e9f82b779ca79a62495afc700f9e2">She looked around and found Baron Lance and raised her hand.

</p><p data-p-id="0f8c589dea9c95685753cbae45e48128">"Baron!"

</p><p data-p-id="bb2ef92bcca7e41959df6d3fed736a32">In her cheerful tone, Baron Lance smirked up and asked.

</p><p data-p-id="92d2e8c3d5150158b724eb404170aa48">"What's the matter?"

</p><p data-p-id="371f44935d75d0083c75d387b6cdd5b2">"Lan Unnie - are you done talking to Count Romia?"

</p><p data-p-id="bbf7a46f1e646f8b992bd40ac76c912c">Baron Lance became a curious face and asked back.

</p><p data-p-id="bfd438524037e5fb8e2a24266bf1c021">"Isn't she here yet? It ended a long time ago."

</p><p data-p-id="53402ad348f3c23cb3113f37c7a8d4e8">"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="4ab998b30ccb1c13c6a053be209959e4">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="9b35e6f9edb7ad619de7f4c4e746fc9b">"Have she met someone else since then?"

</p><p data-p-id="f7b537611430b0f1f7e345f28c03d985">"I don't know about that."

</p><p data-p-id="3aab9e3263182c6616ef1f3dec6f5ccc">Baron Lance glanced at Eustaf with an anxious look on his face and left after greeted.

</p><p data-p-id="955aae011fccf39179d121115010fa6e">Sina said.

</p><p data-p-id="f6f5e02d7c35eb4a5c7407f8171918f0">"I'll go to the women's rest area."

</p><p data-p-id="bfaf40d9f25f499f4f8808fc28b4f3d4">Maybe she have a stomachache!

</p><p data-p-id="d33c2a9d3e27e460a0f45ba8fd3057b8">Eustaf lightly clapped her head, and Sina pulled up the hem of her dress and walked quickly. Or it was because I kept stepping on the front of the dress.

</p><p data-p-id="fdce9867a4f0f3e04e1695abcc32ab28">Sina went to the women's rest area thinking she didn't know how Lan walked so lightly and gracefully, but there was no Lan there.

</p><p data-p-id="221dce5ea5ee60ee7bae1bc3d0257b22">When I asked another lady who was resting, she said she never came.

</p><p data-p-id="692f50a748c0e5454edd045b704d7bcd">Sina was embarrassed and returned to the banquet hall at a quick pace. Just by looking at her expression, Eustaf knew that Lan was not there.

</p><p data-p-id="f94ece882d3b709c9274e2a45359596b">"She's not at the rest stop. I asked and she said she's never even here."

</p>
<p data-p-id="2429793ff3c4d23c03af3e2f085a2315">Eustaf raised his head and gestured to Kiri, who was dancing Quatrium (a fast and cheerful dance song with four people in pairs) on the floor.

</p><p data-p-id="940571811ee2a4a224db8b190f22a1ab">Kiri laughed as she stepped on the steps, quickly and naturally put the other person in place and left the floor.

</p><p data-p-id="6531838e332f47caccbf8372042ffa3f">"Lord, what's the matter?"

</p><p data-p-id="0630962fb77778a9ce6fc8ddec2eff13">"I can't see your master."

</p><p data-p-id="9e23830986cd124aa8d5d92a80462052">"Miss Ran?"

</p><p data-p-id="4fe0d6a7c83ac05ff5f2523b7fe8ccdb">Kiri snorted and said, <br>"I saw she go out earlier, but I didn't see she come in."

</p><p data-p-id="4c14f5a343e907f0f76e78d080864ba9">"Get out?"

</p><p data-p-id="63b5790c0a729e0e7d49f9b903342178">Kiri nodded at Eustaf's words.

</p><p data-p-id="d03d615eb305f026e643636ff14b01c4">"She was going out the back door. I thought she'd go to the rest area. Maybe it's a woman's situation, so wait a little longer."

</p><p data-p-id="77750a77b9304df0a800154902447e74">"For an hour?"

</p><p data-p-id="f0a94d7a5ac954a45721a5052ebbbed0">"Oh my? is it already?"

</p><p data-p-id="49245b628acdb58ee692718f1f5d9631">Kiri looked up and spoke low.

</p><p data-p-id="49f079a8c297face82e1d2589dabeab4">"There were no other reports. The house is safe."

</p><p data-p-id="197b0d23a0fe52a1f864094e8f4dba31">Eustaf shook his hand without an answer, and Kiri smiled and stepped back.

</p><p data-p-id="a239982217ff394f541a2f48f26b6f80">"I'll go find it."

</p><p data-p-id="67a31169eca22120fff4acb551042fe2">At Lumiere's words, Eustaf said, "No," pointing his finger at the top of Sina's head.

</p><p data-p-id="6283e26d6e4de77aff862dde050051b3">"Stuck on."

</p><p data-p-id="ef6e52b43c6492addebaab1fca1e42e7">Sina said in embarrassment.

</p><p data-p-id="ae45d8316777329e80e7faee5dfac2fb">"I'll look for her, too."

</p><p data-p-id="aa9a8b0f63b657f5a6e48d4693ac7b32">Eustaf ignored Sina and left the banquet hall.

</p><p data-p-id="3a0414fef2f4c9995ae29520ff25591b">No, it was about to pop up.

</p><p data-p-id="8d584d403441c0607e9380882b5ead60">When he saw Lan coming inside, he frowned and approached quickly.

</p><p data-p-id="e7335f5250ac1fa85ef58030af7ed8d7">"Youth? Where are you going?"

</p><p data-p-id="add311ada0d201c9c14e8d43f2339114">"Looking for Lan."

</p><p data-p-id="4890e47fe99c722617fbb2863b0559cb">"Oh-it's okay. Sorry."

</p><p data-p-id="98e50f3795d4c141b214c8cffca06caa">Lan smiled and said, and Eustaf felt something strange.

</p><p data-p-id="e232116eb88c3f224083983d0da3970e">"Lan"

</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="a6178f3b935ebc00d6a79daf3eda23ec">"Did you drink secretly?"

</p><p data-p-id="03187673bbd3e4fb2ad525e10e3dc719">Lan opened her eyes wide and laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="f568ec90395650477f58f18f1decbff9">"Why are you secretly drinking when you can drink as much as you want here?"

</p><p data-p-id="ee6c100d6343d33a0384ad25fee7af74">"That's true, but-"

</p><p data-p-id="57894d0d24269cf58700bf28f6a1f971">Something feels strange.

</p><p data-p-id="13e4b0c848e46b7616c2715e633d207e">Lan moved along with a giggle.

</p><p data-p-id="dd0fcb24004c82c20933126d1defda9d">"You can't leave Sina alone."

</p><p data-p-id="608bc0cc0b24e6b3fa3d00a250eb4055">"I didn't leave her alone."

</p><p data-p-id="e0d1aeb507ef8ff4ca19bd61d82d365b">Eustaf replied, and Sina's expression brightened when she saw Lan returning.

</p><p data-p-id="c8ca43b96338065e5586eb788fee384e">"Unnie, where have you been? I was worried."

</p><p data-p-id="65a5f381493a3007c819fa75fe73fea2">"I put some air on the outside. Did you talk well?" Sina nodded her head.

</p><p data-p-id="eb02c652df3ac2cf892d359da273fee2">Since then, the banquet has continued without any problems, and it ended well.

</p><p data-p-id="e612bca2ee24e1a6d1d2a49a1ddbb6b3">However, after that day, Eustaf, Sina, and Lumiere felt a subtle sense of incompatibility.

</p><p data-p-id="78a0fd4234ea38f845f9d39a4a6dee1b">No, that was what everyone in the mansion felt.

</p><p data-p-id="0bfa2db63a838ff312df3ab51d710ca7">If Lan asks her if she's staying away from Eustaf, that's not true.

</p><p data-p-id="280d41fc027131deffff6055969894f1">But...

</p><p data-p-id="8be001c6b6367f5634ab2b70c6cbf10c">Sina looked at the card with a nervous face and looked at Yustaf's face. There were only Sina and Eustaf in the card room now.

</p><p data-p-id="0a66e8895cae813588b39148c560ed0f">It was because Lan took Lumiere out as a porter to get something for a while.

</p><p data-p-id="af9517f8452b27c27c67b68d118aff2d">In this way, Lan often left only Sina and Eustaf.

</p>
<p data-p-id="92c587a7446996750c9c3a77a292165c">Sina said, sneaking over the card.

</p><p data-p-id="8dcd8f94499afc915e7be43022731234">"Did you two fight?"

</p><p data-p-id="8c6aa11ee228662b94385d3d42cf83aa">"No"

</p><p data-p-id="5a039727b5475d78f66c22d4f3f3e412">Eustaf replied and looked at Sina. <br>It is no wonder that Lan left the place like this now. No, it was strange at the same time.

</p><p data-p-id="1e9eddbbed9a04242dbc501b8a7b13f9">You can order the maid to bring the things.

</p><p data-p-id="154c1db9289b635ddf735a5a21ec64c2">If Lan is a precious item to pick up herself, it would not be big enough for Lumiere to need as a porter.

</p><p data-p-id="039304c86107909ffe9979e5ab2ba41d">I would have done it if it was once, but it was already the first time, and Eustaf said it was as annoying as a handwrap.

</p><p data-p-id="3e7612af72c4bb89da0773716021c4f8">What annoys him even more is that he can't have time alone with Lan. <br>He said, throwing the card on the table.

</p><p data-p-id="40e4f01a1080063b91ef2606a926d661">"Did Lan hear anything?"

</p><p data-p-id="e97161ce7842d2058991ca5633022bf2">"No"

</p><p data-p-id="080c1af7389538d8dbd13afaa597a70c">Sina shook her head.

</p><p data-p-id="d6b08fa89b326008727a1e4470e9033a">She was interesting to see the Duke in front of her, but it was quite scary. When she looked at himself, his eyes felt inorganic.

</p><p data-p-id="9c46b65a50e7bc63df41d06d9c360dd4">He is kind to herself only because Lan is kind to her.

</p><p data-p-id="e32e510e7546e2c0e06ce08ba6c41f78">'So I don't want we two to stay.'

</p><p data-p-id="aafa998489ef5e187b34051d0813b353">That's what Sina thought, and she groaned.

</p><p data-p-id="bb00ca012666a8d911e4861d0ce9f4f5">"It's not coming."

</p><p data-p-id="c7025459285c3a2a3944ec8c2df2b986">"She's getting late....."

</p><p data-p-id="b3d03e2c4b143a111bd060d94b299597">Eustaf leaned against the armrest. He tapped his armrest with his fingertips.

</p><p data-p-id="bc3300dae352f77d5ec56c52c7c4f8ba">Eventually, as soon as he couldn't resist and raised himself, the door opened.

</p><p data-p-id="b9eb41feb64406d07d324fc61994bee8">"Sorry, it took me a while to find it."

</p><p data-p-id="502b74eef01b2ad43273527ed20caaea">Ran in and apologized. Lumiere had a big box in his hand. Sina said like a joke.

</p><p data-p-id="ccc338404759ab45091f564bf9704fed">"I thought you were lost, so I tried to find you."

</p><p data-p-id="827eff845182ddb4062cc3224b8e3b07">Really. <br>But of course Lan took it as a joke. Lan said, looking at the two alternately.

</p><p data-p-id="e79b12b8b2b1c1360fb0741b8559ed04">"Did you say anything interesting?"

</p><p data-p-id="1a0ceb7935bc827c6efec6a972f10404">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="057635d038c4ade92d63d6feab4d0f33">Eustaf said so, and Sina quickly shut her mouth as she tried to answer, "No?".

</p><p data-p-id="b1668b6174f9ae42f0d360f985ca40be">It was so obvious that Eustaf wanted to look good to Lan that Sina took his side.

</p><p data-p-id="3c42a519203fbfb203f063b5d8b02a3b">"The Duke told me an interesting story."

</p><p data-p-id="3341d871e63bfb5f49789578cbb933ec">"Really? I see."

</p><p data-p-id="60859c70c93bf8af3e4e5bfda5d762e9">Lan quickly opened the lid of the box and hid her face. There was a black cape in it. The luxurious gloss cut off what it was made of. And there was abundant hair around the neck.

</p><p data-p-id="527e726700254b6db8b7070026134b06">While everyone was looking at the cape, Lan put her face in order. Breathe in a beat and Lan said.

</p><p data-p-id="ab0fdc48ed52ff1072694b1e8a8d5cf0">"I'll give it to Sina as a gift. It will be warm in winter. A cape is a must to live in Lazia."

</p><p data-p-id="7f8c65e83238a710bba3d8b35a94239d">"What? But this looks expensive?" <br>Sina shook her head.

</p><p data-p-id="7508c3d26cdbadb17e5cebd49c4406f0">"What I already have is enough."

</p><p data-p-id="fe27b653b1fc29d8ce32b3f3d09b5085">"No, it'll suit Sina. When you ride a horse, you need a cape with fur."

</p><p data-p-id="0d999bb0591a6b810a45b04dbfbd6796">Eustaf looked at it and said low.

</p><p data-p-id="f78caf63a25fa7d7fff871ca16436de5">"Isn't this your mother's?"

</p><p data-p-id="f330badd723687c00df79228c196bbf5">"Huh, Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="e110af5c2416f30853a681306defc3bc">When Lan nodded, Lumiere and Sina looked at her. Ran laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="0bd6b000ccf3978f4cdf91562948d389">"But I don't use it, and it doesn't fit my height. It'll still fit Sina."

</p><p data-p-id="e13e03ed20576f69a073e3ee9df946af">"But it's a relic, isn't it?"

</p><p data-p-id="6f7892c67cd7447a6cc0ca7c9c91598f">"So, I really want her to take it."

</p><p data-p-id="c056a19f4a180d79fd8963aa476e0784">Lan said so and pushed Sina over the lid of the box.

</p>
<p data-p-id="0575472266715b8eebd396cce10a4bc7">Sina pushed the box back to Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="69b1f76fce09735ece777ccbb873621b">"No, I don't accept this."

</p><p data-p-id="554698688216c9a07a701341f0083001">"Sina"

</p><p data-p-id="c8000256d0825e03684feff8e741c9fd">"Take it."

</p><p data-p-id="9267ae7c6f59132b5ffecb63a32edaf5">Eustaf said, pushing the box to Sina, and told Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="cb14ce81317ffbaf2ce964aa16425dea">"I'll give Lan a new one."

</p><p data-p-id="d9968dd069a6025fe9e1c912e1f4621c">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="8b6568a1c77b4e020a3edbb82a850ac5">Lan opened her eyes wide in surprise and Sina pulled the box, saying,

</p><p data-p-id="2319da0434370eccff87df03c81e3f34">"Oh, if that's the case."

</p><p data-p-id="fb0deb4f71803b060f31c42bfb062fcd">I didn't really mean to receive it, but now I thought it would be better for Eustaf to play the rhythm.

</p><p data-p-id="cf9e5737040ee1dec17ad644dd049e56">"I have a lot of capes."

</p><p data-p-id="e8a4533afeb7e8af6c156433ffcf5b4d">"You just got one less, didn't you?" Eustaf said so and held her hand.

</p><p data-p-id="738b4e04a9698f7a5cf9be8fe4953cbb">"And it's all Lan's money. Feel free to buy luxury items."

</p><p data-p-id="6bfbe987fec4473a29fda06f647fd5e6">He whispered, kissing the back of her hand, and Lan laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="c1a13454df7a263a2a99db91d4a88ed9">Sina laughed and said.

</p><p data-p-id="cbfada9c3c8cb53d7e1c2e3904a436a1">"Then here's the deal. If Lan Unnie loses to Mr. Eustaf in this game, she'll get a cape."

</p><p data-p-id="19e096da31e151e05ce4d0f084394c32">"That's all right."

</p><p data-p-id="80b919fcb34c3cbd67af4d868f1ce010">Eustaf nodded, and Lan groaned and nodded as she had nothing to say.

</p><p data-p-id="5514904475aa464d4a407afbbfa06bba">Lumiere smirked and picked up his card.

</p><p data-p-id="483dd3a6c008ee9d83e3c877c9568219">"You'd better think of a new cape design."

</p><p data-p-id="c06688a34e21d43a31f9f85558236e5f">And naturally, Eustaf beat Lan in the game, and Lan promised to order a new cape.

</p><p data-p-id="445023d16089c01d43718b78f4bdc7c4">******

</p><p data-p-id="bcc440400d2b4dd5686ee5afc9978504">A sunny winter day followed.

</p><p data-p-id="6706a8a295a43a67130c023e9e304c5d">Since then, I haven't seen a spell, so was it a coincidence? I even thought about it.

</p><p data-p-id="7bb9f3cb17347cf6ed6e06968a6e3419">'But it's not.'

</p><p data-p-id="defe11b943c8d29dc087e7119bb4d56d">Lan was rather more anxious about this peaceful situation.

</p><p data-p-id="8c54693efe1a35900b6cab2453a5bb90">It feels like the enemy has already revived somewhere and is stockpiling strength.

</p><p data-p-id="2757766e9ee1fbce12a5881a4366ffde">Lan looked out the window at the horse riding Sina.

</p><p data-p-id="deb30ed7c4f8f423e306d87a57e52c7c">Sina, who is athletic, rode much better than Lan not long after riding a horse.

</p><p data-p-id="d3a62dc07e2043b496c4c393de5bb26d">Lan stopped her from telling Sina that she would give her words, and Eustaf gave Sina another word.

</p><p data-p-id="df4c53bdb4e6d04114e25b6b33902632">Sina was riding a horse and talking to Lumiere. Lumiere pulled out his sword and she swung it and dropped it on the floor.

</p><p data-p-id="638ed996ddb05543ef1bcd61710700f9">Lan opened her eyes wide in surprise, and Lumiere was seen picking up a sword while teasing Sina.

</p><p data-p-id="5b11681b0ff53cb87b9def3f71eb21b8">'You're on good terms.'

</p><p data-p-id="070959d90572808f83957edc2e55ebec">"Earl? What are you looking at?"

</p><p data-p-id="87e83d382ad979da6e663e02274f2bc6">At Dimodia's words, Lan took her eyes off the window and lifted the earring she was caressing.

</p><p data-p-id="67ca7e64576f0d2f8c47eac60caeca2b">"Yeah, nothing. Dia, how's this?"

</p><p data-p-id="7e68d50c05a7ede09f73981fea9ec2f9">"It's an amethyst earring. It looks like a real grape. It's pretty."

</p><p data-p-id="2e2938a7108bacc0cf8aaa4b9c8ef1bd">"I'll give to Dia."

</p><p data-p-id="d95652ca613541170fa3568fc221c72f">"Yes?"

</p><p data-p-id="2744c40a799818182ade72b26fb44a19">Dimodia opened her eyes wide in surprise, and Lan smiled and held out a pair of earrings to her.

</p><p data-p-id="b08ae6153c3bb3649168cacf308adbe8">"It'll look good on you because it's purple."

</p><p data-p-id="033f2b8ee4f098517fa9c95f54589396">"Earl."

</p><p data-p-id="f528819b3fc8a37200936b2228910185">Dimodia frowned on her forehead. For some time, Lan had been presenting little by little to the maidens.

</p><p data-p-id="f40514f864aa294ba4dfb5f8732f15b4">Lan was running out of accessories because it was extremely rare for her to buy them.

</p><p data-p-id="d638da560e0317cc493502c785354ee1">When you say that, Lan smiles and says,

</p><p data-p-id="b3b4210e230dc106c9da0298e741e70e">"What do you mean, there's the Duke's treasure trove." However, it is the treasure trove of the Duchess of Lacia.

</p><p data-p-id="312cb5a26913582de7055712983122c6">It's not an individual Romia thing. <br>Dimodia grabbed the earring on her hand and grip it.

</p><p data-p-id="a11e1a82fe81f57231b2c2aac40990a2">"As expected, what's wrong?"

</p><p data-p-id="0ec1ce691daad075aff006d8f9bae3a7">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="e0683dbfc2764f15ade18545b1c74463">When Lan panicked and saw Dimodia, her purple eyes looked straight at Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="847d67f350a317b21911d59396569999">"I've been with Lan for a long time. And I know that Lan is not a person who does things in vain." No, I'm surprisingly sloppy.

</p><p data-p-id="091873af7165e617aee97b4389c1834e">However, Lan kept her mouth shut, not in the mood for such words.

</p><p data-p-id="19aa21abec9b25ab0a947168f6ebe391">"But it's just-"

</p><p data-p-id="35cecc87fe37cb64b838d27ed9382da2">"You seem to be organizing yourself, don't you?"

</p><p data-p-id="eb6abbb003d9e29c002e94ee36d7045b">That's what Kiri said, and she cut in. Lan couldn't answer for a moment. <br>Because that was the truth.

</p><p data-p-id="35b2693be628cc3cacf8fa3359e1e692">The relationship between Eustaf and Sina seemed to be getting closer, and Lan was becoming impatient.

</p><p data-p-id="2106a7ec6df7162db71fba8cd8879da9">In fact, Lan's body weight was decreasing due to stress.

</p><p data-p-id="8beafacbba892b8df650f0420927ce8e">Eustaf frowned and said he would get anything he wanted to eat.

</p><p data-p-id="4c232dda1b8a2595daa619fd99ddd333">Lan laughed. <br>"No"

</p><p data-p-id="6e915873fa8e133bca529fd09f6fd34b">Kiri's eyes narrowed. <br>"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="611ed291e072d6082442d353b13bb092">"Yes. Just, Oh." <br>Lan opened her mouth and closed it.

</p><p data-p-id="20bf17e17bac316d4921bb5c7bc4b13f">'I'm doing stupid things.'

</p><p data-p-id="370f8f7adaa68830a32e5c576872a156">Lan sighed, thinking so. I was aware that I was stupid, but I couldn't help it.

</p><p data-p-id="12727dbd36df5dff16e6f7195724c6a3">"Miss Lan, we're not fools."

</p><p data-p-id="99e3d1dd98e5e5167058d1d1bfb3162b">When Kiri said it, Lan opened her eyes round. Dimodia was surprised and looked at Kiri. said Kiri.

</p><p data-p-id="fe97825aeb75f60fecf3940eee28a465">"Isn't this related to Sina and the Duke?"

</p><p data-p-id="03476dfc46f04b1709fa32af7358c8af">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="91f9742758dcbeb9f5988943c235efa1">Lan was so surprised that her voice slightly flipped up.

</p><p data-p-id="f984ba308a2cb3e9b92f8e488f734c59">"As expected."

</p><p data-p-id="51f2668265cd4b8cf21f6514ce1eafe3">Kiri said to Lan, happily.

</p><p data-p-id="1e34b5f7db22c52d386fa6cdbabc885f">"Everyone in the house thinks it's weird."

</p><p data-p-id="9e60125cc6165ab8b98933849b98cc17">"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="81f3fae0e3a98ff5027eeb135d7d3c1c">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="1c376582fc6ea1283f22c0e36cd4c580">"Kiri"

</p><p data-p-id="9c272816f849023c7a2780a621c31572">In embarrassment, Dimodia grabbed Kiri's arm and shook it. Kiri put out her mouth.

</p><p data-p-id="cd34b0df464804812c5e91cb8c1fd295">"Of course we don't know what you're thinking or what you mean. But-"

</p><p data-p-id="cd92cb4584da6b9042a0e68ba5a6624c">At that time, there was a knock on the door, so Kiri shut her mouth.

</p><p data-p-id="a6bde91c06715441a3f7364f6d09c25a">"Lan Unnie?"

</p><p data-p-id="74ef188f8ab209f8583534af39c3e8b2">At the sound of the voice, Lan said, "Come in."

</p><p data-p-id="4ffdf5bc149d5427fa33511df4d6cfc0">Sina came in as soon as the door opened and said.

</p><p data-p-id="0764a1f27dbdea3407e9ea836a1f3d10">"Would you like to go sledding with me?"

</p><p data-p-id="a3780119cc56d4da900c768e8b66df27">"Sled?"

</p><p data-p-id="eae6f5e5370c6d59b4c5454532956d0f">"Yes. You were riding with Lumiere before? So I figured it out-"

</p><p data-p-id="1c12c1d31a2957f5264fad723f7e7ce9">Sina giggled. <br>"The Duke built a sleigh. Let's go ride it together, okay?" Sina got up from her seat in. And asked.

</p><p data-p-id="607a71b0f4aa14423c05314e80d3e9d4">"Is the Duke coming with you?"

</p><p data-p-id="66387faa9d600e564566bdb7b5f33217">"I haven't asked him yet."

</p><p data-p-id="a9444082be1d84d8ce7eb0c4d296b53e">"Then let's ask."

</p><p data-p-id="631842d2c9f25b831cc89f40b76cd216">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="4807504671242cc2cbfc9b05e0338ab4">Sina answered cheerfully and stood in place, and Lan snorted and asked.

</p><p data-p-id="81762bf81f1c521fa47df0bdc416e0f3">"Are you not going to tell him?"

</p><p data-p-id="efbbc1bee4b936082b45456c4ad65959">"Oh-I think it's better to have a maid.........?" Sina carefully asked back, and Kiri nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="10d815eaa2f8f7baa81af0deac5691c5">"I'll be right back."

</p><p data-p-id="931a7258768ab1d1b7863acb3e4b3721">"Then change your clothes first. You have to wear it tight." Said Dimodia
