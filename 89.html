<p data-p-id="37f38d9fdde71dd344a5a14d46135312">'Then she said she lost her sight not too long ago.'


</p><p data-p-id="302147672a24c8f425d38c53fdd24618">And yet she comfort yourself. Sina admired Lan's mentality. Lan said with a serious face.


</p><p data-p-id="d637e0165c51294302c56f41b45bb201">"And I think I know a little bit about why Miss Sina came into this world."


</p><p data-p-id="e7ae5ddda1a15fc33d1495cf79fa44dd">Sina opened her eyes wide.


</p><p data-p-id="105939b6b3d41ea3b78e7d0cf71f3a0c">"Why, why? What's the matter?"


</p><p data-p-id="57ea9d5d2ad62743a7e8c28e2835b6cd">"It's going to be a little longer, so sit down again."


</p><p data-p-id="9268c007c72ae34f7c23a176214bb93e">Sina sat down because Lan gestured. It was the problem she was most curious about.


</p><p data-p-id="c100d27a872fdd0404bc9fc4e01a57a6">Why?


</p><p data-p-id="394fc53d63ed5c0ba49808ff45d85d0b">Why did this happen to myself?


</p><p data-p-id="353f88c0fff9a564651fbd54bcaa7386">Lan coughed in vain and explained the origins of Lazia.


</p><p data-p-id="3bfe4f2fcee9648a5ea47b7d898119ed">"The Sealed Darkness" and "The Great Sage Iveria."


</p><p data-p-id="c570cb2e30064bc99948de7c91aea8db">Sina listened to the story while wondering.


</p><p data-p-id="8a4c21284b7da39b56ce3021c7e2607d">"And the seal is breaking right now. I don't think so."


</p><p data-p-id="8378aee836d392d2c9d800ece62f5023">Lan sighed.


</p><p data-p-id="6268fb52909a84f45a421eb63b0fc41d">"And the darkness is looking for someone. So who is he looking for?"


</p><p data-p-id="ce8c7ab1c0787871f1c858c360ac3960">"Iveria."


</p><p data-p-id="4eac8fd3eea75876c16fafee67f471cd">Without much concern, Sina replied. Lan nodded.


</p><p data-p-id="043ae3dfd669089df0c197f3c98f5afc">"But I heard it was a thousand years ago?"


</p><p data-p-id="fa1c78ed2dc02e75d7898555de16a573">"Right"


</p><p data-p-id="2009e05cdb56ed7ab4b6645c2955cb41">"Isn't she, the great wise man, already dead?"


</p><p data-p-id="bea53f6352c70dc3da9937e9d132e2e2">"The story says it's gone, but it's probably dead."


</p><p data-p-id="cf84f1e425d02e59bf161c224ceeebbb">Sina looked at Lan's face calmly talking. Sina was somehow thrilled to see her trying to fit her invisible eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="9f9ffefd5f157381fb24b1ef1a7e45f5">She was really thinking about herself.


</p><p data-p-id="52c4dc831d2875c08352311c18ce3645">In this strange place.


</p><p data-p-id="ccaf2826bcdf0a1dd787b10c5f866d23">Nevertheless, I couldn't help but tremble my lips.


</p><p data-p-id="70a01b58aea694bf9c150f02ded59931">"So, he was mistaken?"


</p><p data-p-id="5fac43ca1492bceb2f290e0cd4c1162c">"When I saw the painting of the Great Sage Iveria, she had black hair and black eyes."


</p><p data-p-id="15e182cf87ad64299567fc646971f661">"That's ridiculous! Don't tell me there's no black hair and <br>black eyes here other than The Great Sage. That's not the story, is it?"


</p><p data-p-id="19a98e099a34ecfc3dfd8f4c1d61036a">"No."


</p><p data-p-id="f6b29847fa365598153161d2888706b0">Lan shook his head. Eustaf has black hair.


</p><p data-p-id="4105d30aeb562803047c97634ea69ca7">"Just, Miss Sina was unlucky. It's kind of an accident."


</p><p data-p-id="0193fd1da32840db2d6f3c4b89903b8a">Sina opened her mouth wide.


</p><p data-p-id="19b711f776c11ff8afc9c365d6499a9c">It was ridiculous but understandable, so she couldn't say anything for a long time.


</p><p data-p-id="184a4eeea20f6c8a2cd73643c5aa15e6">If she came here because of her strange mission, she would have been really unbearable.


</p><p data-p-id="3bec2a6862a08ed5a421031089e8c23f">However, even if it was a wild coincidence, anger was the same.


</p><p data-p-id="0b130f7808d184f786283ec5c7a50e48">Suddenly, Sina said


</p><p data-p-id="cf1c90e321d938a02f2a3773af102940">"Isn't he the only one who can send me back to the world?"


</p><p data-p-id="202833d8e77de5db099b6e000f3c1a1c">"Let's find out more about it. Let's call the wizards or the elves."


</p><p data-p-id="8efbea24b42e863da8dfb9154f2d4b16">"Elf?"


</p><p data-p-id="4ab998b30ccb1c13c6a053be209959e4">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="b3295b57c2f97fdc2d0a1225f8d043b3">Sina opened her eyes wide.


</p><p data-p-id="40689d2e896faf38160269b719c4ef33">"Do you really have an Elf? Elf? Not human?"


</p><p data-p-id="77c76b03153f51a937f915c95736c1b7">Sina wrapped her head.


</p><p data-p-id="8a9b0cced0e98b638484861dcf3b6e36">"What a different world."


</p><p data-p-id="416ba39df39fce68562c781b0b5ceda4">"I guess so."


</p><p data-p-id="caa6b10ac695e07d4152596337a5d681">Lan said so and asked Sina to let her know if there was anything she wanted to do through the maid or Lumiere.


</p><p data-p-id="5064038e80316eba28ce04a7015d316b">Sina said she wanted to see The Great Sage painting, and the group moved together in front of the huge painting hung in the hallway.


</p>
<p data-p-id="ef88d6dedf593823f1175c74a07ee078">Sina said when she saw a painting of The Great Sage standing with a shining magic wand.


</p><p data-p-id="d1b82dac101b6af432408bf5f451da8c">"You don't look like one." Lumiere nodded.


</p><p data-p-id="54ebb353dc061fd8e69087f3532cc0e7">"The great wise is much more beautiful."


</p><p data-p-id="1a7409b53df77a050aa38fadb86f0aec">"Lumie"


</p><p data-p-id="b2cc33228ad784ea9f349eb36b81a2e4">When Lan frowned, Lumiere grinned at Sina.


</p><p data-p-id="7b2333196ddd1ee89bd09cf9bd4c4c38">"Excuse me."


</p><p data-p-id="c41e672ff58dbff5776290af1a3f089e">Sina's eyebrows went up with that hateful smile.


</p><p data-p-id="6eedb096dcb9b56fe182fd234aa11ada">When Lan turned to Sina, Lumiere said, turning her shoulder slightly.


</p><p data-p-id="7ef337538e9838419ad3aebbd32ea503">"This way."


</p><p data-p-id="269d30f1aa8c022811d3a36b24ccc5b8">"Oh, I'm sorry. Miss Sina, I'll visit you often - Lumiere, not this way."


</p><p data-p-id="17ce68f7c152d7a599d46f065c557425">There was a sobbing sound somewhere, so Lan opened her eyes, and Sina barely held back her laughed and held Lan's hand.


</p><p data-p-id="c12339658f26c2695c841653663c8159">"This way."


</p><p data-p-id="00207c236bd24290b5fafab6d198b2b2">Lan sighed.


</p><p data-p-id="2af774079d7533a217918735f655c9b3">"I'll come often, so feel at ease."


</p><p data-p-id="1cb2edb119640fd1e1ce7c20e3cff15b">"Yes, thank you- there."


</p><p data-p-id="1a0ceb7935bc827c6efec6a972f10404">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="c85b496b9b236fbb9dd46bf8d357494f">"Can I call you Unnie?"


</p><p data-p-id="7f71db48164a5f47507254f7fc8169f9">Lan nodded at Sina's words.


</p><p data-p-id="25d6a0c8b3abc799ba97d32db9f7b11f">"Of course."


</p><p data-p-id="4e77fb6684329d98b03d9d60faac57cf">Then she took Sina to her room, and Lan grumbled to Lumiere.


</p><p data-p-id="1e641100501eafe4325f5e7fb58b062a">"No, do you want to make fun of blind people?" Did you miss me talking about the painting?


</p><p data-p-id="d68d34f836159baab514b1512e8241a4">"I thought you'd get mad."


</p><p data-p-id="dfa8fb09013974d8aa8d37b999329675">Lumier's words made Lan wonder.<br><br>"Do you want me to be mad at Lumiere?"


</p><p data-p-id="c16436d15c261cccf1a88b90637246c4">"It's the stairs."


</p><p data-p-id="3902f2126d37f41aaa318ba0147c72bd">Lumiere said so and said after holding Lan.


</p><p data-p-id="d7843f83311a48470e9140d03df97cfb">"No, not me."


</p><p data-p-id="918a40cf185147a82b40df9eb1240af7">Lumiere bit his lips slightly and said low.


</p><p data-p-id="c2c6fc48535e6a9d3eb2ff0189e91b1d">"Because it seemed so easy to forgive the Lord."


</p><p data-p-id="e88904b9d5653fc9685931ac20714afc">"....."


</p><p data-p-id="f6e552fe13ca766687ea6fb61d5190f2">Lan asked because she couldn't know any more.


</p><p data-p-id="3efba1fa318d0d1ae7dc304eefeb6120">"Youth? Me? What's there to forgive or not?"


</p><p data-p-id="64629a6bc2e1d072fafe030280a40797">"If Duke hadn't caught you, this wouldn't have happened."


</p><p data-p-id="dc28e748d2868af29d4e634964f4e9fb">"Lumie."


</p><p data-p-id="8675c097ba5aa415c7ac42ec0e91568c">Lan reached out and stretched from his shoulder to his cheek. Lumiere enjoyed the sensation of her fingers.<br><br>"Youth gave me a choice, and I'm the one left. And my eyes will get better soon. Really."


</p><p data-p-id="23c4a090a1562f4679ad92072323a8f3">Lumiere's face changed suspiciously.


</p><p data-p-id="5ebafe905d9d4871861a9fb960671a64">The therapist shook his head, and her eyes heal?


</p><p data-p-id="6d38f19746feb9711a19669fba52f5e7">"Master doesn't lie."


</p><p data-p-id="81f3fae0e3a98ff5027eeb135d7d3c1c">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="c170f468d51a7b1fdce3c7c531a9c5ab">Lan nodded and asked Lumiere again.


</p><p data-p-id="aa698df205e63869824f70fa8777e6b0">"Really, really?"


</p><p data-p-id="e8934fafca792ec40da1cac74b65432d">"Really, really."


</p><p data-p-id="20dd02b682d23ffc6c31323b98719e2f">Lumiere gave a long sigh with his back against the wall of the stairs. He held her in his arms.


</p><p data-p-id="378a5a615ca89afd826602740cb19528">"Thank God. Really, really."


</p><p data-p-id="cfa0417bca72c30f1bd708167e13909a">"I really think so, too."


</p><p data-p-id="3b16578b428049aa52398c086a122c8d">Lan nodded and Lumie asked.


</p><p data-p-id="93fabcf691470ad8786a9c4aa7c82ba9">"Does the Lord know this?"


</p><p data-p-id="e7458a51f512c8849d945ead6eedb3e8">"No, not yet."


</p><p data-p-id="4d0d456f2ec13ca42e097f0c03b2a5bf">Somehow I missed the timing to talk.


</p><p data-p-id="416fb119dbe91a6cf5a24970a81e375a">'But I think I'll be nagged about it....'


</p><p data-p-id="79f3b3ab1148293662129699474d577d">I told you not to do business with the Spirit, but I did.


</p>

<div class="trinityAudioPlaceholder"></div>
<p data-p-id="dba3da0c1e578784ecf78e3258bcb6f2">'But it was inevitable, so I think he'll understand?' When Lan was about to laugh, Lumie whispered.


</p><p data-p-id="fd2116f5138dc15992edcdbc830270ad">"Can't you just keep it a secret?"


</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"


</p><p data-p-id="f1f362c0c72a54ba3a142d650e56c893">"The Duke may be heartbroken." Lan grinned.


</p><p data-p-id="a8f9b8e982a7aa8a0249899b939ef175">"Except for personal feelings?"


</p><p data-p-id="3d569e7113d2ed70d6899e0838723702">"With a little bit of personal emotion."


</p><p data-p-id="e9fa64e5cb9f9f086e74f38d8bfcd906">Lumiere said so, bowed down, kissed Lan's forehead, and began to walk with his back off the wall.


</p><p data-p-id="216704b10250b30dbb26b26f9dde377f">"Lumie"


</p><p data-p-id="231eb99eadda961d2d6f997fb89f7fe6">Lumi said when Lan, embarrassed, called him, rubbing her forehead.


</p><p data-p-id="91439b71cb367130b8ece08b191e6b88">"I was dumped and I accepted cleanly, but I still like my master. I can't tell you how I like it."


</p><p data-p-id="9b5e634346389fe59c3e1310fa6755e7">He strode up the stairs and walked down the hall.


</p><p data-p-id="4721d53a86579b3be0669a94e578dae8">"Lumie..."


</p><p data-p-id="236cb7b847bd270bd2b15305846b78a8">"I don't like that kind of sympathy."


</p><p data-p-id="5baddfa729ab13f5b119c8eae448e2d6">"I'm not sympathizing-"


</p><p data-p-id="4b2f1dce4d52e3eb2cba7d4c917cb077">"I don't even want to be sorry."


</p><p data-p-id="6f71c85cdd995a0a063c23586b63b28c">"That's, All right."


</p><p data-p-id="fbb3df2d0f55a164b9cc6f166db6c95b">Ran nodded and Lumiere smirked.


</p><p data-p-id="47660dc618257ad93c27625f33282896">He dropped her off in front of the door and opened the door.


</p><p data-p-id="3d8f6c9ff9cc8e2a977cadde1f60e82c">"Of course, everything depends on your will."


</p><p data-p-id="84b4f3a3acc45bc98947fb133059a652">With a quick smile, Lan said what kind of face he had, after groping his face.


</p><p data-p-id="c330cfee62486fbaef3b763a3bf2a353">"Thanks for the advice."


</p><p data-p-id="9086a0bc067ce8d55ee8ce8a5becc4c7">Now I am convinced that I should tell Eustaf about it.


</p><p data-p-id="14fc777df02e28807ae198715ecdbe86">Lan laughed because she could feel Lumiere frowning.


</p><p data-p-id="50f04e766344748e36f20cf1ee5cddf2">"Lumie, I'll ask Sina."


</p><p data-p-id="c691754c56dadc80b3153dbe75d1c03e">"All right."


</p><p data-p-id="cbdc303adb6f5c2ff62a1ab86ffff1a9">He nodded his head gently.


</p><p data-p-id="5390c911317126de4bde4051c09b9b7c">Anyway, he didn't hate the woman who came from this world.


</p><p data-p-id="04053f3f0fd5a03774d3752ff2a09eaf">No, you might think she was out of her mind, but she had a place similar to Lan.


</p><p data-p-id="1cae184cc77e4ea39e685f270e206338">Especially the way you see yourself. <br>The same personality, the same perspective that doesn't doubt that they're.


</p><p data-p-id="ee7637cec2f5de4b2d695ba58097cd4d">'You said you came from a world where there was no identity.'


</p><p data-p-id="b00a9608623ab4707661d8a0b649b085">Lumiere left the room, wondering what kind of world it was.


</p><p data-p-id="79efb26d20ab076b8799aeafdcffcede">Because Lan was favorable, Sina's attachment could be used properly, and she was easily accepted into the Sky mansion.


</p><p data-p-id="56cb9c0b0e7133a60efb86cb9681a4f9">Eustaf thought it made sense when he heard Lan's explanation.


</p><p data-p-id="f687590d0013ca026a08b6723b371a77">"Is it kidnapping from another world?"


</p><p data-p-id="bd72f37df00264c65657d2425fa2184a">"Yeah, that seal. I asked Haresch to send me the data if he had any. It's arrived, so....I've been reading and listening lately."


</p><p data-p-id="dc06eb6881dce1175bf8ecd40c20d9c0">I was asking Kiri to read it.


</p><p data-p-id="011d09ef101c36b01a92ec6c6b9352e4">"The seal must have been locked up in an ant cave or something."


</p><p data-p-id="0fcdd9ac2c8ca9fef35a095bad133239">"Ant cave?"


</p><p data-p-id="9cb64c985a4f40048e24195fea563822">"Yeah, complicated maze. There's only one door in Lacia. But there are 100 forked paths, and they're connected back to 100 forked paths-" Eustaf nodded.


</p><p data-p-id="519871c2460eef7fab8143dfd1cdd656">"Okay, you're saying there's a lot of fake entrances."


</p><p data-p-id="cca7db91731d650fe023ea5e0057e758">"Yes, but now the Darkness has found the real location of the door."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>"That's what happened."


</p><p data-p-id="230293ae45364664506c3cc318aa2845">Eustaf squinted his eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="d9180bd67ea28c0c6609e4e5507b998f">"Anyway, beyond the door is such an ant tunnel world, and that must be why the disconnection from the rest of the world is weak."


</p>

<div class="trinityAudioPlaceholder"></div>
<p data-p-id="01b8f011a79a3e9456835b76fa15ae28">Lan said so and sighed.


</p><p data-p-id="5f0d55cc15d7a472dad50ac3547c4b1e">So she came over to Lazia, and so did Sina.


</p><p data-p-id="04d86da164793b189ef2da5b972bbaee">"And Eustaf, I have something to tell you."


</p><p data-p-id="65a869072e54c6a6205b309cfd494980">"Tell me."


</p><p data-p-id="445e7f667be6b67169b50ac5601ddbbd">"My eyes-"


</p><p data-p-id="436c0d76a8277530b3f2e3e45342ad6d">Eustaf said before she said anything.


</p><p data-p-id="a3d85e5b3bc080ce7da892a0c682c8fb">"When it's clear, I call Haresch. If he's an Elf doctor, there's got to be a way."


</p><p data-p-id="15f53ec6e0567a33cbab4cbd8204e45d">"No, it's not that. It'll be fixed."


</p><p data-p-id="7c7b52886ebb383b47fb231d1b46e888">Lan spoke so nonchalantly that Yustaf could not tell whether she was talking about her wishes or facts.


</p><p data-p-id="5783dd4cb118a36acdd81f4b2f484647">He asked back cautiously because he couldn't figure out what answer to give.


</p><p data-p-id="1dc2ecd5c6fe5662739dccfc5ecea574">"It's fixed?"


</p><p data-p-id="4107995e3e70a9de082098fd170156c6">"Yes, the Spirit promised."


</p><p data-p-id="523699642043370a8898f1463fd10032">"Did you make a deal with the Spirits?" Without realizing it, Eustaf voice rose.


</p><p data-p-id="b3d7ecbafcb56dda002561fb66971286">Lan said, "No, it's not that." She said what she had been through. Instead, the story was not about Usla's tragedy, but about calling a spirit that she knew.


</p><p data-p-id="4e43b063894c4cc9b8979783e48b55a3">So when the Spirit said that her dream appeared and told her about the ice wall and that her eyes would be better, she could hear a deep and deep breath.


</p><p data-p-id="a73819a9d1eaba373bc5b081eec76050">"Youth?"


</p><p data-p-id="75a1d09a3908efbbf3e19de97f9df286">Lan groped his hand on the table. Eustaf wrapped her hands around his face and held her tightly.


</p><p data-p-id="39e1778a175d45a49b8d3e43d1ad7b29">Words didn't come out.


</p><p data-p-id="f8eafd19ea965ab9f504d637d04c0a68">A great relief struck him.


</p><p data-p-id="8b849213f6999b5a33f81fe81694cb61">Even if the conversation did not go back and forth, holding hands was enough.


</p><p data-p-id="2da0f6316888a6964aa27129ca40a718">Long later, Lan said playfully. <br>"Then can I ask you a favor?"


</p><p data-p-id="6b23639d792c36ccc359c5f05d1bc50a">"Tell me."


</p><p data-p-id="76bb4a2f858bfd2d23a992c30702217e">"Play the piano for me." <br>At Lan's words, Eustaf smirked.


</p><p data-p-id="42a19f3bb311cad22bac7c474e3d7719">"I will."


</p><p data-p-id="53402ad348f3c23cb3113f37c7a8d4e8">"Really?"


</p><p data-p-id="d316a43023fe92eb7d04bc4403ded33f">"Really."


</p><p data-p-id="8f0267d36d1423639532700b86c1b9d3">He said so and got up from his seat holding her hand.


</p><p data-p-id="c3b8dda21c4ed339186d807784e08e76">Entering the room where the piano was located, Yustaf sat Lan next to him, lightly knitted him, stretching his fingers.


</p><p data-p-id="077f2e191bf03b1131ac4120243c25e9">"What do you want me to play for you?"


</p><p data-p-id="2e3ecd4ab243da55e8c8a297d22fdce2">"Anything."


</p><p data-p-id="8463f963031de0639b1827ec3dcd627d">At Lan's words, Eustaf thought for a moment and soon knocked on the piano keyboard. It was a familiar children's song.


</p><p data-p-id="6912ac5e96f4f255e4abc53eb9b5d6e5">A light song, Lan smirked and leaned on his shoulder.


</p><p data-p-id="69cc3ac2e9dc9eed71950e42849de793">"My Lord, you're good at playing the piano."


</p><p data-p-id="7091c688c9119779b58e15df6c820d01">Eustaf glanced at Lan and began to change the scale more quickly and complexly. Lan opened her eyes wide.


</p><p data-p-id="1e99239e029fb65a5dae3fa90a8e39b0">She felt his hand and touched the front of the piano, but it didn't catch any sheet music.


</p><p data-p-id="830d37807b081e89a21473aedbe4baf4">"You're not looking?"


</p><p data-p-id="631842d2c9f25b831cc89f40b76cd216">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="b6a431d69d0007cd70f4742bc5aee2e5">"Youth, that's amazing."


</p><p data-p-id="02bb4a8cd6b4760c6087de8b623524e9">Lan was constantly amazed.


</p><p data-p-id="14eb0c1e2ce0fcfd8146c86fbd549229">Eustaf play three songs in a row, and Lan clapped hard at the end of each song.


</p><p data-p-id="9d9e8f98089b07fddf2f3310e69a3323">"Our Youth has pretty fingers, and he's good at playing the piano."


</p><p data-p-id="4be1758a21d08c938cd5bfe280b113a5">At her words, Eustaf smirked and carefully handed his hair behind her neck. Then his hand gently swept down her neck and wrapped it around her back neck, and Lan enjoyed his kiss coming.


</p><p data-p-id="779e7c458895e554212e242037d86614">His soft touch of lips and his hand holding him were all good.


</p><p data-p-id="6ff81b33d9974e5169a154522c146cb3">After a while with their lips removed and their foreheads facing each other, Lan said.


</p><p data-p-id="2f00f4f3c044b7aeb2f4373fd68f15ff">"Thank you."


</p><p data-p-id="ec9e48e2ad7041601d500b65c2e1478c">"What do you mean?"


</p><p data-p-id="ef82093c0067c382849e69119764ac53">"Sina. For being nice to her."


</p><p data-p-id="a82cad70bf520644de82a93366d315ff">Lan also heard that Eustaf was listening to Sina's wishes.


</p><p data-p-id="189ee35281b4449f669363c55e916102">"Because she's a guest of Lan."


</p><p data-p-id="95ac05aae81c70576b1a1383f6766247">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="d22cd942ba6c5e25f0c38b38c6947aa1">Lan closed her eyes while answering.


</p><p data-p-id="f120271cace819bc0b3d6ea080ba2d7e">That's all we have now, but maybe not.


</p><p data-p-id="8ef0c1ac620b8cc56a871b011a28d224">I was anxious but unstoppable, distressed, but unable to speak. <br>On the other hand, thinking about such an idea itself was a great example to Eustaf and Sina, and I felt like I had become a narrow-minded person.


</p><p data-p-id="1191133ad8d33e90a08c7e0d3ca11f43">"Eustaf."


</p><p data-p-id="960a8395cf10325eff2215b4c1a1040e">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="ea230b15e2bcb893f37bd5c056ac24ab">"You know, we were supposed to get engaged in spring."


</p><p data-p-id="d0577621a93d1f060875ca19a99e4048">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="c11a5c5ca12794a0c9ce186eb08a517c">"Can't we put it off a little longer?"


</p><p data-p-id="3a4a2c0a85e7518cac3512dcf400452f">Eustaf answered in silence.


</p><p data-p-id="62fedb3bac77cec358c693410addb1a4">"All right."


</p><p data-p-id="72cdb072d19ec87dcad2ce9f74244b5a">Lan was relieved and anxious because questions such as "why?" or "what?" did not come back.


</p><p data-p-id="19fe2943088a27764cf6d61dd672cd61">Ran tried to smile, feeling contradictory feelings.


</p><p data-p-id="743ae33004ccf903c9f944b82f1f2861">"Then according to the Spirit, I will be able to see it by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow."


</p><p data-p-id="92421f27cc0a3b3234c3208c6ad8314b">"Is that so"


</p><p data-p-id="a7854eb5d12df39df9cf3a32e9f19a60">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="0fd7a1143e1ff1db8beb03f9ccb3fb36">"Then I'll have to prepare a big banquet." Lan laughed.


</p><p data-p-id="3207254a49379e74847b89e5b1f8b17f">"You don't have to."


</p><p data-p-id="bbfff5cbdb5715117bc16fb25926bede">"I want to do it for you."


</p><p data-p-id="8b156eb6fac2bfc05917ab2eee68b29f">"Then a small one."


</p><p data-p-id="9de8afca2b617edd7d76a52b684334c8">At Lan's words, Eustaf nodded, "Sure," and kissed her again. It was a deeper kiss than before.


</p><p data-p-id="ab35d9ccc8d76881df15933898a13071">Eustaf soothe her as if he was trying to erase her anxiety.


</p><p data-p-id="ab24ed860434ea64fdb09d975f451350">It was not until Lan breathed out hard that Eustaf said, falling from her.


</p><p data-p-id="7aa4ad4d1e4bc446e2b2b476ec4f4186">"I'll walk you to your room."


</p><p data-p-id="50038598118a32535a07b171c9ddbcf4">Lan nodded with a red face, and Eustaf hugged her.


</p><p data-p-id="15162001f3631f016d22056943b1d09a">"Youth, I can walk."


</p><p data-p-id="7d913233098c5fe01d4525e54b9df0fa">"I know, but this is due today."


</p><p data-p-id="cb4d1d45f9b5529324b8c659e46092d2">At Eustaf's words, Lan went to the room, hugging him gently.
