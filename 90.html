<p data-p-id="feca46d0599d8d16e955d46d43cd3885">Anyway, when I opened my eyes this morning, the world looked white, not black sight.


</p><p data-p-id="1b7bf1db5854670cc90215a5d98783bc">'Can you see it?'


</p><p data-p-id="5158bae6ad4c821a4dc925b20fda514f">Lan had her eyes swollen.


</p><p data-p-id="a3648a42a0a9e72f5ac9df13848df2b6">However, it only looked white, but it was not.


</p><p data-p-id="bc0b488dc3e86617d17a00114e60ae48">'Can't you see it? No, I think it's vague.....'


</p><p data-p-id="10cfdc073bf634390773576822b0a2ed">Lan lay down and looked around. Everything looked foggy.


</p><p data-p-id="7f6f82b2b2c964975080e9ef86693560">'Let's wait a little longer.'


</p><p data-p-id="ec7ac929f4ddf4755d061caffcaf84be">Stressing her nervousness, Lan blinked while lying down. As I waited patiently, my vision became brighter and brighter as the fog lifted, and everything looked clean.


</p><p data-p-id="ab197655acba9ba7ec01182856c4a586">Lan jumped out of her seat and jumped out of bed.


</p><p data-p-id="dc5fa547641334cdef54db86714a6160">"Earl?"


</p><p data-p-id="36f23d8ca2f8271e2beb080f8b740a02">Dimodia was surprised, and Lan took her hand and spun around.


</p><p data-p-id="4960cd9ecbcb0da25045011d58b2aae6">"I can see it now!"


</p><p data-p-id="96ace1e04b7e575c51a34f13cf3afc23">Dimodia opened her mouth. Her expression was funny, so Lan laughed loudly again.


</p><p data-p-id="967f9d6beb4ca2051b8d59ab3595c92e">It was so cool to see it!


</p><p data-p-id="5a4892571782678c94d1e6061b581ce6">The glitters of sunlight, the dazzling colors, the faces I see again, were so good that I couldn't stop my excitement.


</p><p data-p-id="adf5e4b593a6494a46b262f41161a936">"Dimodia? What's going on, Earl?"


</p><p data-p-id="ceafe8b5b274eceb5c2cd162f9a094a8">"Come here, Kiri! Soda and Kara!"


</p><p data-p-id="bcace9beb66c219a396e59ed76c17d41">Lan shouted loudly and took the hands of the maids who were called in at a glance and ran round and round.


</p><p data-p-id="50f84414c20ef0065226778ef6dcf439">The curious maid also cheered and circled together when Lan said she could see.


</p><p data-p-id="295ded70e28928b4083a5d530a1438a9">After a long turn, the situation eventually burst into laughter, and everyone stopped laughing.


</p><p data-p-id="6d3d7199603acd8c6ba979fd5f46bea5">Dimodia giggled and said.


</p><p data-p-id="f9af55a7176beb3f556eae8c4b07ca1d">"But don't overdo it. Let's call a therapist."


</p><p data-p-id="6bc696f71c4ab5c51668510e0f09b8b6">"That's right."


</p><p data-p-id="d22182c35d3335a92c4353121ed9e904">Only then did Kara come to her senses and put Lan in her seat.


</p><p data-p-id="560066648981bb6f8d4000b610ec8ef1">As Soda rushed out to call a therapist herself, Kiri said, sweeping her chest.


</p><p data-p-id="2831ef19e4d04105bdfb40297f43bbae">"It's really good to see you again, Earl."


</p><p data-p-id="5ffb0704e7b5dff3700913a607ebe861">"I think so, too."


</p><p data-p-id="bd5334f487f0f318e65a19a0b9316355">Lan laughed and said.


</p><p data-p-id="8f21503eab7752c06bf4f3614d7a8fa6">"Good to see you again, Kiri."


</p><p data-p-id="739b706e4cc3567d5dd691294b9b01d7">When Lan said with a big smile, Kiri laughed, too.


</p><p data-p-id="a43be43beb3fd09b7bcec3d0ac7276aa">"I'm happy to see you again."


</p><p data-p-id="dd5c150d1625f92218c33438f3610721">asked Dimodia.


</p><p data-p-id="3ae288959d7842551e8e71c8ff392f71">"Is there any inconvenience? Does your vision look distorted?"


</p><p data-p-id="51baf41c4575e1613b30696c52fb3a05">"No, nothing like that. It's the same as before."


</p><p data-p-id="f1f1663ab96444666170a2a064172564">Tears welled up in Kara's eyes. She said, stamping tears with a handkerchief.


</p><p data-p-id="35571a4adf257ec1b10ecfb835295963">"I'm so, so glad."


</p><p data-p-id="4ab998b30ccb1c13c6a053be209959e4">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="d80cdefc0fd3ba20f35f93c7fdee801a">Lan also nodded and thanked the leopard spirit once again.


</p><p data-p-id="bdb4dd77a2dd5e606c19a86a774e3638">And I will never use the power of the Spirit again.


</p><p data-p-id="25843459807cdc26f718d95075fcd37c">Soon after, the healer ran as if flying in, followed by Eustaf and Lumie- and Sina-.


</p><p data-p-id="5d9b19dd032c97115f26f1ae3b2887f7">The therapist opened the examination board, examined <br>Lan, looked into her eyes, and said, "You really can see it now."


</p><p data-p-id="254d08741ed76dd350f9e65e82651207">"That's what it is."


</p><p data-p-id="7922703b265c32f3a199072277815707">Lan laughed and said the therapist seriously.


</p><p data-p-id="4bb836c0535e4328060faac9a3f3cfb5">"But be careful for now. But I don't see any abnormalities."


</p>
<p data-p-id="1a38771a92e039f1a4d1a653eea59dfb">The therapist spoke to the people who were anxiously waiting for his words.


</p><p data-p-id="a3aafd1b5d49f46a7a610b79b88b436d">"I think Miss Lan been cured."


</p><p data-p-id="34ed60416117843b8924c100056349cb">Sina ran over and hugged Lan tightly.


</p><p data-p-id="cb62de9fa1a142422fbebea3dc8d6fc2">"Unnie, it's really, really good-"


</p><p data-p-id="9ef3b93e2274bf2c8474894bc4f88f5e">Then, as if it was her job, Lan laughed and soothed Sina.


</p><p data-p-id="9fb592d505d61451b98aa0503479012a">Missed the timing, Eustaf looked at Sina with his eyes thin open, but smiled when he met Lan.


</p><p data-p-id="e37ac7fb9e1ce150d23096aff7295336">Just as Lumiere kicked his tongue and pulled out a kitten, she pulled Sina's neck off Lan. Sina frowned at Lumiere, and wiped her face with a handkerchief he put out.


</p><p data-p-id="3edfc677a77bba1a78d89e413e6140a7">Lan was only then able to see Sina's face apart.


</p><p data-p-id="e9a035a28f81cb98d1d715e3adc4f0ac">She was beautiful as I thought.


</p><p data-p-id="98b1acf78fb1df09edda53e5f12c6b35">The black straight hair is glossy and falls long down to the back of her back, and the pupils of the eyes are big and shiny.


</p><p data-p-id="34f0fa379d17e0ae0d11a978d64083d8">Besides, she was dressed like a knight.


</p><p data-p-id="460a021ce19f96ebb312b3ceceae7617">Shirt and pants.


</p><p data-p-id="ca9c4de58823072225df59407cc0593c">I laughed somehow because it was the same as I thought it would be.


</p><p data-p-id="1cd5f1c7cb938fa6a69eb2ad22895151">"Nice to see you like this."


</p><p data-p-id="7723a825c9a4da4dc2787dbcffaee96d">"Yes, nice to meet you, too." Sina nodded her head.


</p><p data-p-id="32c138e376b67155d96d4e801ec2034a">After a disturbance, the atmosphere of the sky mansion brightened up at once.


</p><p data-p-id="e6bfb7108c921b13e354fe2ecf665631">Sina, a stranger, could feel the atmosphere with her skin.


</p><p data-p-id="af8f27da21f37b60943c38d4143bb2ac">The late New Year's Day, which was delayed as if it would not be held, was held and the mansion regained its vitality.


</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******


</p><p data-p-id="c94c1f1aec41e7dda3b8161edc72ccc9">Sina looked at her in a dress several times in the mirror.


</p><p data-p-id="96dbe570651c4196204c4aad36fa7369">'Amazing ······.'


</p><p data-p-id="8c4d25cca180b7c34904d6ae0d62add8">The light blue, fresh dress looked good on her, and Sina refused to lend it to Lan as a gift - and the hair was beautiful.


</p><p data-p-id="50ea4f846c09fd1affd225bc4ab6bdbc">The hairpin with countless platinum decorations looked like a waterfall of stars. It looked like a perfect match with black hair.


</p><p data-p-id="61ce13b60f4a99cc29987462e7cf1814">"It doesn't make you look pretty, either."


</p><p data-p-id="c8aa90c1eaabd217b40bb7c8ed0c1528">Sina said when she turned to Lumiere with a bang.


</p><p data-p-id="009f8cef8d0c386de03536d3c7bbd901">"Better than their red beet-like hair."


</p><p data-p-id="3c9bd6f3bd0c11c775bffe4a32ddc0e2">"Red beet?"


</p><p data-p-id="4d4ad16541366ebd846182776e400210">Lumiere opened his mouth when she said something unexpected.


</p><p data-p-id="f936c9041f41f259c4d755e45263b0dc">"By the way, the Duchy of Lazia is great. No, because it's a duchy...."


</p><p data-p-id="041f03473fbe8f78f69a4f61560ef5f5">The whole house was decorated. Velvet ribbons embroidered with silver thorns and gold threads, and huge wreaths of green and red fruit. <br>The modern hotel's Christmas decorations were unlikely to be this fancy.


</p><p data-p-id="a24daa9e430fcdc221413fbb96c29fa0">In addition, magic lamps were added to create a fantastic atmosphere. The same was true of facilities with hot air and hot water.<br><br>'There's a blanket like an electric pad.'


</p><p data-p-id="6b5a34c43b921d24904abcaf72416c88">There was nothing uncomfortable for Sina to stay.


</p><p data-p-id="0ca56042891ba78f32bc291ccabf5640">And the ball!


</p><p data-p-id="ca7eaeb0b705eedf4693503cab2b1348">It's a word that makes a woman feel excited.


</p><p data-p-id="fc660e87f4d14d9528e4a88fde90f240">"Let's go before it's late."


</p><p data-p-id="76cb7f80135559c6d66c1f79dd3a85a9">Sina said so and smiled with a single smile, so Lumiere laughed.


</p><p data-p-id="4a599ae52ca2b2da3032e6d9220e8511">The New Year's party was held at Diamond Hall, and this year was also abundant.


</p><p data-p-id="e045a9b6c55577ceaad0e6b0740ad3eb">Lan looked pleased, saying, "Who would believe that we were in debt a few years ago?"


</p><p data-p-id="74030d097673d85dbda1c476a1328118">Soon after Eustaf's brief New Year's address, the orchestra began to play, and Lan glided out into the floor holding Eustaf's hand.


</p>
<p data-p-id="e8a9ca9b50d27c035612de0e249fa704">Now her dancing skills had improved considerably.


</p><p data-p-id="97051d749289cda9a4bb39017c4d26c7">'As expected, practicing anything makes you better.' Lan thought so and danced the doublet skillfully.


</p><p data-p-id="48c2ade68fd29ff8fa601dc7588857a1">As the two danced the first four words, soon after, people came into the floor and danced together at intervals.


</p><p data-p-id="d6a2d97d5658ffdc39e726ffd09e57fa">Lan opened her eyes wide when she saw Lumiere and Sina dancing together.


</p><p data-p-id="12d1a7cdc2614f798113e2ce9e230723">Eustaf turned around, frowned as he saw Lan staring at Lumiere.


</p><p data-p-id="e232116eb88c3f224083983d0da3970e">"Lan"


</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"


</p><p data-p-id="5d7b38bf0f5c47b471305e48384b4bcd">"I quit dancing with Lan now."


</p><p data-p-id="999ec9f5fa35f5657ceef0d3fd416fd9">"Oh,yes"


</p><p data-p-id="9d358c29cb8fa6006b025e285f08e802">'What do you mean, "Oh, yes"?'


</p><p data-p-id="bd0090648ad8b83e5ccdc58e8d0f8d81">Eustaf's eyes became thinner. He glanced at Lumiere and Sina.


</p><p data-p-id="b75a688ffcd4b0ac020435d5bc2e1595">"They two are dancing."


</p><p data-p-id="9d867df29f28a8943b1b25e165247f79">"That's right."


</p><p data-p-id="1267c96a72b6f285a2ce79a53bde9066">Lan felt nervous. Of course, since she with Lumiere, it was none of her business with Lumie and Shina.<br><br>But, but.


</p><p data-p-id="08ab8dea5aabeaafae5b82a0db0a9213">'Is second male lead okay?'


</p><p data-p-id="cccafd47df81e5f7d80568264e81e030">Isn't it too much to be dumped twice.


</p><p data-p-id="24e7445dde26ea4c41de1d61cb6f3eea">"Lan"


</p><p data-p-id="c3f5165fab8bd2e5fd33c6bbc636b1f4">It was only then that Eustaf called her back and looked at Eustaf.


</p><p data-p-id="6c32b4375823d805bc65b0ddcbe36cc9">She said awkwardly.


</p><p data-p-id="82ec30c716c5cb6d4d1f85c6ae4f3761">"Sina, isn't she pretty?"


</p><p data-p-id="ff4487a68f5fbeded0f9f6e8fb8169ec">"Pretty." <br>Eustaf nodded.


</p><p data-p-id="eeda8cdc8f6b0f23abb072072e7c99c7">He knew where all the dresses and decorations he gave Sina came from, and he also heard rumors that the maid cared about it.


</p><p data-p-id="177279451f0a6d7cd6fbaa610bdcd1c2">"Her hairpin looks good on her, too."


</p><p data-p-id="513ff65f99bcd1e5340c087218152252">So he praised the decorations that Lan would have given her, and Lan smiled faintly.


</p><p data-p-id="f4403c09a9831b430ebe4bf1fdad9f76">"I think so, too."


</p><p data-p-id="9eaee2c65da01ee67f7346444a0b4328">Then she added.


</p><p data-p-id="257840ba1354de4c32acb00b35339807">"Why don't you do the next dance with Sina?" Eustaf hesitated for a moment and nodded.


</p><p data-p-id="c691754c56dadc80b3153dbe75d1c03e">"All right."


</p><p data-p-id="0e85be8cf40faa8ba40bb1ddcc1c9034">Lan cares about Sina, and the easiest way for her to get a favor in the mansion is for Patriarch to welcome her.


</p><p data-p-id="c076beacbfa7948eb3b32c4337e2784a">'Thanks to Lan, hospitality seems to be sufficient.'


</p><p data-p-id="5fb65eb192052418a26d358031c5a095">I don't know why she cares about her so much, but Yustaf thought he would treat even a snowman if Lan wanted to.


</p><p data-p-id="42ec132b01c218a08831b39a56703a8d">At the end of the first dance, Yustaf went to Sina and asked her to dance, and Sina blushed and saw Lan once before dancing with Yustaf.


</p><p data-p-id="dbd9b25b776675428409ae35895cf0c6">Unlike Lan, Sina had a good motor nerves, so she quickly got used to dancing with a short lesson.


</p><p data-p-id="5bdea25f51073434470aa4501addda9d">"Dear Earl, would you like to dance with me?"


</p><p data-p-id="4e75a8efa5d6c8b9bd8d8aa1e8319bbd">Since Lumiere politely asked for a dance, Lan took the hand.


</p><p data-p-id="a20ec75ae2132193dc44575dcf0de47d">Lan said with a giggle.


</p><p data-p-id="64a8f05a9b3418086bbbd7c4084fa92b">"I remember the last time I tried to teach you how to dance, but I failed."


</p><p data-p-id="9a3257ebee3ddb92057582482ea461de">"You don't know any of the male steps."


</p><p data-p-id="8d495dd117cc583399b29f89587c7f91">"That's right. Lumie good at dancing now.... I think I'm the only one who can't."


</p><p data-p-id="35b53b5a81d6ea5ac3e2344c392256a4">"Am I a good dancer?"


</p><p data-p-id="820b76a5074cab84562bc5fddd843d08">"That's enough for a doublet. The other dance is-just a mistake."


</p><p data-p-id="7eb70ce239da0c2cb8927a36ba6524de">Lumie smirked at Lan's words. He looked at the dancing scene with Eustaf and whispered.


</p>
<p data-p-id="f7bd00753a4670382f2232c632876d42">"You two look happy."


</p><p data-p-id="acee47c4a632cdb507e917df577b5dba">Lan glanced at Eustaf at the words. He was smiling rarely. Sina kept telling him something to chat about.<br><br>"That's true."


</p><p data-p-id="4ba8dc1a49b802801d852d78d0e4ac27">Lan looked away by saying so. I couldn't look straight at all.


</p><p data-p-id="9a601ab2bccf30949bf3ceda25c7144a">Lumiere looked down at Lan's face for a moment and asked.


</p><p data-p-id="787dbc194eb15d110a2da724707cff91">"What's going on?"


</p><p data-p-id="d9968dd069a6025fe9e1c912e1f4621c">"Huh?"


</p><p data-p-id="884633895f40424083febb94fe93b578">"The Master and the Duke."


</p><p data-p-id="137b5047b0be7ab2c70c422519356ff3">"It's nothing."


</p><p data-p-id="817a707146d2a771532e8c39e7674c84">"But the Duke is dancing with another woman?"


</p><p data-p-id="68632e63392fcf3d03d1b8365ee6dfc1">"Because I asked him to dance."


</p><p data-p-id="9fddcdebeaefa7a1ccc7ca0d2de9b40a">Lumiere frowned at the words. I know Lan's taking care of Sina, but isn't that too much?


</p><p data-p-id="63ad0b8d2644bf5d377d87aa4d6cfa2e">Lan smiled at Lumiere.


</p><p data-p-id="0b2b613296d61788faedb76f048e4bd4">"Sorry"


</p><p data-p-id="cf293129d428eee698f74440f93bfe84">"What?"


</p><p data-p-id="0dea9ac90c8eb3b094886a74134fe034">"Didn't you like her?"


</p><p data-p-id="784015db7be0ec876dfc69d7b32d7225">Lumiere opened his eyes wide at the words.


</p><p data-p-id="e40b6e06ffba7883d2043e1469cd75e1">"Do you mean that spring girl who's a colt?"


</p><p data-p-id="c27d9944b5a71164e5cd61125db6266f">"Huh-no?"


</p><p data-p-id="8c6aa11ee228662b94385d3d42cf83aa">"No"


</p><p data-p-id="1dc96f2c8cbb6a53a89bb10e3e5482ec">His tone was determined and fierce. Unknowingly embarrassed, Lan began to make excuses for Sina.


</p><p data-p-id="9b81f47f3ee921aa9c27e2888a84bf8c">"But Sina's a good girl. She's a good girl, she's cheerful, she's athletic, she's a good horse rider." Lumiere felt like an oops.


</p><p data-p-id="67662a31f04b8f412e65f4693bdc13f5">Now he's taking it as 'do you like women?' But that's not what Lan meant.


</p><p data-p-id="82ebd43d00fec42a1efb6a67ef34abf8">Lumiere sighed and said.


</p><p data-p-id="f57c2910392e0a1d299b844c4263ba81">"She's a good girl. I misunderstood. And this is a different story."


</p><p data-p-id="480003a42261bba9de8ee3639bbe6fb9">Lumiere glanced at Lan. Her emerald eyes were good to see him straight.


</p><p data-p-id="00c19972e8c2aa6f464ee6e5b1824789">"She look like my master somewhere."


</p><p data-p-id="33d76a9cf647704dfc87dce3df074228">"What?"


</p><p data-p-id="5297ce07598a640df7b60ce978b3179e">Did I?


</p><p data-p-id="02d95254817e8d250a8b68016a94c4f8">With the heroine?


</p><p data-p-id="e89f9bd4fcf6112803962ec9cc3c02f8">Where?


</p><p data-p-id="5808cdfa812684fae3600951863ed0bd">Lumie laughed when Lan opened her eyes wide.


</p><p data-p-id="c3aad0598f81917ecbd493ca825b3057">"The fact that you see people as people."


</p><p data-p-id="17a0e0e6cfdc7ef5a18bb4da2f1214ad">"Then you see people as people--?"


</p><p data-p-id="e10d1059fc34c5c3f517a3ab8a551809">"No, I look at it differently."


</p><p data-p-id="fc9607da0e49105d723a430b1e568f80">Lumiere thought about it for a while and said, <br>"I turn around here."


</p><p data-p-id="e3dbc79418870b751ef780284b9a1b7b">"Lumie-"


</p><p data-p-id="c9e9ef3e43e9d6637f39bf63aa57be86">"No, I'm not self-help, I'm serious. The Knights are children of the nobility. The second, third, or fourth. I grew up in a completely different environment, and it's something you can't cross."


</p><p data-p-id="4c96af02d603ce87650c37add626761b">"..."


</p><p data-p-id="d879037433f4945e8d99c42ce118cf49">Lan bit her lips not knowing what to say.


</p><p data-p-id="8e8497a9bb78533ee09c90b3a344552a">Lumiere grinned at her face.


</p><p data-p-id="e88db2d6feadd5ab1412527d7b5efdab">"You don't have to look like that. But that kind of outward appearance is the same for Sina. Maybe if it's a camaraderie like that. Besides."


</p><p data-p-id="67aa43545941608356ed3380710bae77">Lumiere frowned at each other.


</p><p data-p-id="876f9a076bd123d805779f646abea7b2">"You know what she said when I told her I was a slave in the past?"


</p><p data-p-id="68bbffbbcb7926e6ea741dfa90b6e4f0">"What did she say?"


</p><p data-p-id="167bf7054d51a54289db07b14b879938">"She said, "That must have been really hard."" Lan opened her mouth, and Lumiere grinned.


</p><p data-p-id="e1b416b01df374b42415cc105ecdc8cd">"I really held my stomach and laughed. She doesn't have that concept, does she?"


</p><p data-p-id="ba92e4b9d399a365629463d773ed50b9">That's strangely similar to you, and I like it.


</p><p data-p-id="6516e3bbcb6d3ee8453b98b0b274a710">Lumiere swallowed his backstabbing.


</p><p data-p-id="2a618cf02fa0bf77a9aa0825e3394aee">When the dance ended and came out of the floor, Sina and Eustaf approached.


</p><p data-p-id="ac7eb8b11e3b8542aa7a241711f11c4d">Sina smiled and grabbed the skirt and greeted her gracefully.


</p><p data-p-id="033f2b8ee4f098517fa9c95f54589396">"Earl."


</p><p data-p-id="09ec60ab8016bfeeec6fd4be85cb6347">"Just call me unnie. Between us."


</p><p data-p-id="a8476725611c4834f858add953edff30">"No, I wanted to say this."


</p><p data-p-id="57e50405950b05198d460bfbaeaca22a">Lan laughed again at Sina's words. Right. I've done it a lot when I was young.


</p><p data-p-id="cbed993afbf15a050fe136cd75f157a1">"Would you like to drink something?"


</p><p data-p-id="d999d6c0e806250c0557c1a79688e62e">At Eustaf's words, Lan nodded, and the men left to pick up their drinks. <br>Sina and Lan whispered a man.


</p><p data-p-id="e2a48cb7c16f35edcf7e714ac0d2f02d">"The Duke is so cool."


</p><p data-p-id="d397e9bf55224d579f456d89f88d4af4">Lan felt like her heart was pounding somewhere.


</p><p data-p-id="76e5e0f0e46c7376142332cd670b5f99">But she laughed.


</p><p data-p-id="b6a601a59893f468a1300f246b3b4fb1">Lan won't stop you if you go with the flow. She had no right to stop. Eustaf will be happy. I'll survive.


</p><p data-p-id="f6045c2cadc5c3d514250c9311060bd2">"Right?"


</p><p data-p-id="1a0ceb7935bc827c6efec6a972f10404">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="3cd61f53b4c053b774a0169832eff631">Sina smiled and tried to say something, but over there came Count Illuminati.


</p><p data-p-id="f0b983a7ddeafeb47503306ace8b02ba">He kissed lightly on the back of her hand and said.


</p><p data-p-id="1eb2aa93e1b32a5d0a50ce48cbe1585a">"I heard you were seriously injured. I'm glad you're okay."


</p><p data-p-id="bfc14528fc3f4c64c20f99d7e9911f63">"Yes, fortunately, it's late, but I'm also holding a New Year's party."


</p><p data-p-id="377a72715deedd7c66b3be3ea8aa6269">Count Illuminati turned his head and saw Sina. Lan described Sina as a "guest from another world over the door," and asked the count with a look of wonder.


</p><p data-p-id="d9fa31592cbae0a53cbf59b5585b5b1e">"Are you human?"


</p><p data-p-id="070db83b4d14326ad1b472fa47178852">"I'am human."


</p><p data-p-id="c34467d532c914c22e26d134523638c1">When Sina smiled back, the count nodded, "I see."


</p><p data-p-id="a3cc0a74e274ee479af52e299855774b">Lan introduced Sina to others in turn, and in addition to curiosity, Sina was tenderly accepted thanks to the disciple of Lan and Eustaf.


</p><p data-p-id="d45d4171c89fa5f127d46b42bd6e7d3d">Anyway, the Duke of Lacia is a guest that was certified by the Patriarch. <br>Then it was natural to be polite and friendly.


</p><p data-p-id="30f7b68ad909cbcac113f5e504d4978e">When Lan looked at Sina and the people exchanging questions, Baroness Lance whispered to Lan.


</p><p data-p-id="b41cec965f29460557af96aa9664d195">"Can I talk to you for a moment?"


</p><p data-p-id="72bacdbed6b7d045f825c9a917e4e473">"Of course." <br>Lan laughed and told Sina.


</p><p data-p-id="dbeb4311b3bae25add32f0aefecbb438">"Take care of Eustaf and Lumiere when they get back."


</p><p data-p-id="81f3fae0e3a98ff5027eeb135d7d3c1c">"Yes"


</p><p data-p-id="f18ff6aa7abc657dc304efd155f9f0a0">Sina nodded, and Lan talked to Baron Lance. It was not a big problem, but it was about whether she could repay the money when Baroness Lance next year needs a big pay off.


</p><p data-p-id="26828b38e3e85ee79d64a57d729eff74">Lan asked several questions and nodded.


</p><p data-p-id="57facd5a0e84da7f2a71596b18134f92">"I think it'll be enough. I'll talk to Eustaf, too."


</p><p data-p-id="2b016b500715f4d5fa8de44e9950fe1d">"Yes, thank you."


</p><p data-p-id="0c98aeb14223ad260f904b9037bc1939">Baron Lance smiled happily.


</p><p data-p-id="a58ef24090be755f525d0352463cd7ab">Lan was about to go back to her seat, but she stopped walking when she saw the three of them standing and talking to Eustaf, Sina, and Lumie.


</p><p data-p-id="14a8d6ad198038494c7561537d5224dc">Somehow, there seems to be a world of only three people.


</p><p data-p-id="5aa4df4fa242b835313966abfd4adde3">It's like a pin light falling only there. <br>The inside of my chest throbbed. <br>But if Yustaf and Sina go well like this, the flow will be back to normal, and then Yustaf will be safe.


</p><p data-p-id="bcab400d93a76e6723e73ac5813526a8">After looking at it for a while, Lan sneaked out to the terrace before her eyes met.
