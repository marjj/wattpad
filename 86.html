<p data-p-id="ef5ef69f4dc3ba703bc46ec31871d561">Sina Appearance <br>"Lady!"


</p><p data-p-id="8bf11c1b50c5ef90c0bbf447905569f1">Blaine reached out, but his hand barely grazed the hem of her dress.


</p><p data-p-id="abb3e01b415099fc19034e94c561fe70">At the moment, everyone froze and stopped moving and watched Masu, who grabbed Lan, go up into the air.


</p><p data-p-id="9947e41970fb808721ca165b0c6997c7">I'm sure he was on his way from far away, but as if he were using magic-


</p><p data-p-id="24a796e0dcaa9133f7ac2e409903e223">'Is it magic?!'


</p><p data-p-id="a6430da2fed74f1b1bc2dc6cc002189f">I have heard that there is a simple magic among Fliying Masu. The kind of Masu that caught Lan quickly drifted away. Everyone looked at the scene without a sense of reality.


</p><p data-p-id="6a544b40812289d875ee9f54315e57b9">"No!"


</p><p data-p-id="14b6e1922bbb79d3c40b03d6d15346be">Then someone made a noise, and Blaine felt the same way.


</p><p data-p-id="d3a521cbf360bf50ea472c726270a942">Masu threw Lan into the air. Blaine's eyes slowly saw her fall, a small dot.


</p><p data-p-id="8fc9bb76241791a4723a1e19a48d8de2">Masu circled through the air and suddenly twisted his body and crashed.


</p><p data-p-id="39557beadce20e4ff1d6b365f40b2954">Thump-


</p><p data-p-id="7b0ecf653b4a259ade660402438a5934">Even though the distance was far away, a heavy sound was heard faintly.


</p><p data-p-id="243d9c71ffb69736a84c04390a57b13a">Blaine swallowed his breath. He looked unknowingly toward the cave.


</p><p data-p-id="26778b3ad7fa2fef92cb5af6906b07d6">It was quiet in the cave, and maybe you can't hear the outside.


</p><p data-p-id="3024a9c959337719c5d75a1f97072995">But-


</p><p data-p-id="39577af5f4f5f96c446ad6ab27431c84">Blaine regretted sending Lumiere away so easily. Then Ross got on his horse and said.


</p><p data-p-id="69fdf3e9c530c69f4a758b58e204eef2">"I'll go away!"


</p><p data-p-id="922caec95bd1419fbdef6fd3f3c5da78">The silence was broken by the horse and some quickly jumped on the horse and volunteered. Blaine nodded his head.


</p><p data-p-id="15113ecef4a00c27edbcf210c4fa4be4">"Maybe, she's alive."


</p><p data-p-id="e2b879e671c6524a523d6e88c28638a6">But he was not sure of himself speaking, and so were the listeners.


</p><p data-p-id="44a438440262e11f1775826efb19d366">Ross kicked the horse in the ribs and began to run, followed by the group. The rest stood by on the spot.


</p><p data-p-id="ae94c1c771aef7b3271c0c43c9c95761">Because his master is in the cave.


</p><p data-p-id="b596d5242d8b20e7e78dcbbc30766d0e">Blaine couldn't leave this seat. We cannot leave Eustaf defenseless. He clenched his teeth.


</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******


</p><p data-p-id="2588e96b5a6a8aa606f4771a7272642c">Lumiere turned his head at a strange sound. When I looked up and listened, I heard a scream again.


</p><p data-p-id="e623680b4c4e0bbfd0a888e62f468a2e">"Help me!"


</p><p data-p-id="8dfcdca7df0deae6c8a2d1ceb5d5560a">It's definitely a human voice.


</p><p data-p-id="ce358e7f24af5225b58b898fd45e9486">'How did you hear this?'


</p><p data-p-id="4efe3503139d9f92981735a70b6b3b92">Lumiere kicked his tongue and drove the horse in that direction, but he gave up in the middle.


</p><p data-p-id="26e163cc9adbb98a1e154b4103c5c0ee">The snow deepened and the mountains became steep, which was too much for a horse.


</p><p data-p-id="6b8bdfc7925de1f4c13c39849b0dabd9">His eyes were so hard that Lumiere checked the spikes in his boots a few times and started to run fast.


</p><p data-p-id="2d7fb31988a2c074b4ccd487c536a758">"Here you are!"


</p><p data-p-id="cf94f9db07869f2764eb9b9ec6fd2f54">When he shouted, the other person shouted again.


</p><p data-p-id="8fe710ac6e0041d0926d24e859675ade">"Ahhhhh! Help me!"


</p><p data-p-id="272a55bf31e8e47d21034c9311ad56b7">It was a woman's voice, but her voice was amazing. If she do something wrong, that sound could cause snow.


</p><p data-p-id="6d0d1da15e70928d64bd6d9d828b399e">With that thought, Lumiere accelerated.


</p><p data-p-id="77b04ee1d4d108262c453310a6755d1c">His voice echoed through the snow-covered trees, blurring his sense of direction, but he did not hesitate a few times.


</p><p data-p-id="33dd2e8badb68d108213a960428214ff">He soon gained sight.


</p><p data-p-id="49e466d0548689cfa79bc730a64e9642">After confirming his opponent, Lumiere poked his eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="ec6286f0c3e35c922d4360445458c308">She was an oddly dressed woman. And then-


</p><p data-p-id="b8d70e22e5e31a916b369c85775b2a91">Lumiere pulled out a sword and ran past the woman.


</p><p data-p-id="d8473bfdf42511fa99eae17b61cfe6be">"Behind the tree!"


</p><p data-p-id="aa3233fb35af0e9a799809afac6bd991">And he cut off the water without making sure he followed her orders properly.


</p>

<p data-p-id="1e2a31d4836dd50252d3ea77e16a172a">"Cam!"


</p><p data-p-id="235858bf473b73397384725c0d0579ed">The big wild dog-like beast was cut off by a blow. But it wasn't just one. <br>Lumiere knocked down wild dogs one after another. He was bitten on the leg by the fourth, but his teeth did not go in because of each side, and he hit his opponent's neck with his leg. <br>That was the last time. <br>Lumiere twisted the dog's jaw with a blade and took it off his clothes. <br>He shook off the sword and looked around. <br>I saw the woman from before behind the tree. It was useful to be shaking and not run far away.


</p><p data-p-id="7a79ff2955a05b72327f12c92b0fbdc1">Lumiere asked. <br>"Who are you? Why are you here?"


</p><p data-p-id="65557a4fc98699f2af5c88fba60dfd75">"That's what I want to ask! Who are you? Where are we?"


</p><p data-p-id="31dc4628c884248c70130d9f8f11dfb8">When she saw the woman shouted loud, Lumiere paused and walked to her, and she stepped back and looked around. <br>Are you looking for a weapon? <br>But there were only white snow around her, and she used evil.


</p><p data-p-id="55a19684983fae0b4a4961c75c63bea8">"Don't come near me! You cosplay perv!" Lumiere was emotional for a moment.


</p><p data-p-id="f11442dc8bfec60b1d1bd5b04872c8ad">I don't know what cosplay is, but pervert.


</p><p data-p-id="867fc7d4553510d53efd34ae9ac7d771">"Didn't I save your life? But why should I hear that?"


</p><p data-p-id="1a9009be27dd80fd6fb66873e4c7b3b3">His words were justified, and the woman spoke with a look of confusion.


</p><p data-p-id="7a2e5e7ec1606004f4c5d4f98a633c4d">"Well, I'm sorry about that. I mean, where the hell am I?"


</p><p data-p-id="8b50d758ace20a017f691564feb2484d">"Lachian territory, ice wall."


</p><p data-p-id="17aea5c055f55ded10f5b108d25e420f">"Where is that? America? England? Or France? No, because it's winter. Is it Northern Europe? Finland?"


</p><p data-p-id="e956c5530d9c09efda74a4d1cd2d111f">When I saw her muttering nonsense, I thought she must be out of her mind.


</p><p data-p-id="492cde83240f416f896ef2d8ca79b620">'Well, that's why you're on the ice this season.' Lumiere said as he inserted a sword.


</p><p data-p-id="5627eb3cbf7283620b1590698b01c332">"Let's go together. Because my master asked me to save you."


</p><p data-p-id="a72d2bfa24b1c97a9cec817eeec6ef85">"Master ·····."


</p><p data-p-id="abf16eef551ee844e48ff3b05361657c">The woman's expression became mysterious.


</p><p data-p-id="7baa6b876329aeea344d8a756d180536">After a moment's thought, she nodded. Lumiere asked.


</p><p data-p-id="699fed5a2732da9e95ed813dcd3486b5">"What's your name?"


</p><p data-p-id="9b2c517607592b37651b62db311ff6d4">"Sina. Isina. What about you?"


</p><p data-p-id="1a7409b53df77a050aa38fadb86f0aec">"Lumie"


</p><p data-p-id="1b3eed7e3c6b77858045e46f0eb4dc05">Lumiere answered briefly and began to pull her arm. You can't run away with a fit of madness in the middle. <br>Sina was annoyed with him pulling her arm, but she decided to follow. He had a real sword and knew how to handle it.


</p><p data-p-id="8fb1fd90b73f148c082c9d3d836620c9">He cut down four dog-like monsters. <br>Then I heard a voice from afar.


</p><p data-p-id="ce426ba8f7365feef279e0c9b9ff5f1e">"Lumie!!"


</p><p data-p-id="b90799492bbb15084f9b49f92f2bbc5d">"Did you find it?"


</p><p data-p-id="3ac4ffbaf7eff75a09a6ad1c395a61d9">"What? Are you a real human being?"


</p><p data-p-id="472f2330d7a2a2e167482900181e895c">Without realizing it, Sina stopped, and Lumiere glanced at her and said tenderly.


</p><p data-p-id="6cba2428b2a9ed32ef5230ab0585bef6">"It's okay, they're my colleague."


</p><p data-p-id="710bd9bae875a7dd023f291b4104abab">"Colleague ····."


</p><p data-p-id="d7e34af38b431ffb7ad2817c4a1330b6">Lumiere's colleagues were similarly dressed in strange armor. They blinked at the sight of Sina.


</p><p data-p-id="0cb077510d9544bbb633d32cd64fba77">"You're a real person, aren't you?"


</p><p data-p-id="90aa5fd674c9549619404b4e1a84a551">"No, why did you come into the ice during this season?"


</p><p data-p-id="d7925054b0ce320cdfe5e0e4cdb5606d">Sina shut her mouth tight. It was beyond her knowledge.


</p><p data-p-id="e9245604ac4d29459e5fbe6ceb829507">She was climbing a mountain in autumn. It is rare for young people to climb mountains as a hobby, and she liked to climb mountains alone, so she was just climbing mountains alone.


</p><p data-p-id="ecc4fcdc015adb64436b4bef29b82e7d">I was dizzy all of a sudden, but it was snow. She was panicked and chased by that monster. Sina wanted to hear the explanation of this situation the most. <br>Lumiere peeked at his colleagues and twirled his fingers around his head, and everyone's expressions became strange.


</p>

<p data-p-id="867f1c70e1946b28c02592f522da753c">"Go back for now."


</p><p data-p-id="f79a412664a9b2e46f8a86ab26a5612c">"Count has good ears."


</p><p data-p-id="0938bfd1358cb1aed0b39f4d8f3918ff">When everyone said so and came back to the cave, I knew the atmosphere was unusual. <br>Lumie quickly realized that there was no Lan in there.


</p><p data-p-id="a5c5b1f939463582146c9a7017c9b7ef">"What about Master?"


</p><p data-p-id="16704ee5ef2d9826d66ab55aa2ff5254">When Lumiere's question asked Blaine, he let out his saliva.


</p><p data-p-id="d32fcd636bdd4a4b57410794fd980a61">"She was snatched by Masu."


</p><p data-p-id="403e1c70c3ef863b7920f0eeabddc177">The simple words were not understood by Lumiere for a moment.


</p><p data-p-id="d95652ca613541170fa3568fc221c72f">"Yes?"


</p><p data-p-id="d716c30ba829c2b329aea844f496c2fc">He asked back without realizing it, and Eustaf came out of the cave with a tired face that took much longer than usual. <br>He also noticed that the situation was strange. I glanced at Sina standing there and asked Eustaf.


</p><p data-p-id="e4e2bac1497e437244f4e64166485882">"Ran?"


</p><p data-p-id="5dc5d1112484de1cbed0b282d1ec44da">"That's--"


</p><p data-p-id="6e8df53a91df59b2be65875349777c96">Blaine spoke briefly of the situation. <br>Lumiere's knee is weak. He staggered and grabbed the horse behind him.


</p><p data-p-id="2bcb03f09857202acb72ca37704edeec">Eustaf's face was so white that it hardened. However, only the snow burned frighteningly blue.


</p><p data-p-id="2a9269638f314dfaebdfb6dcffa922a4">"Which way?"


</p><p data-p-id="84d43a1dc7ca8793a51480d152d8c4db">That's how Eustaf asked and dragged his horse.


</p><p data-p-id="24b00d260f6090edec4d3708a6f5d36d">"I will guide you."


</p><p data-p-id="88c79cc83788bf799c8b164dde752087">Blaine climbed onto the horse and said, Other knights got on the horse quickly. <br>Sina was embarrassed and grabbed Lumiere's arm.


</p><p data-p-id="536a48d7a0f23650612f42711c6f4231">"What? What happened?"


</p><p data-p-id="1470f607474c78c92be14bf0b5fac210">Lumiere thought he wanted to leave her here, but he recalled Lan's request. <br>She's must be saved, Lan said. <br>Lumiere got her on his horse, and he got on his horse.


</p><p data-p-id="8b45b4236102d00b2f827ffcd8846973">"Hold on tight."


</p><p data-p-id="080791c986ea91378d2d3ea4a9c8c5ba">He said so and started running after Eustaf. <br>Despite the shaking, Sina shut her mouth tightly. The silence was grateful to Lumiere. <br>Running fast through the rough road, Blaine stopped halfway. <br>I couldn't figure out which way to go beyond this. It was difficult to make the distance possible because I saw it from afar.


</p><p data-p-id="15bc14674cd1334020eaf8a1adbc464a">"Lord Ross will be here first and looking for her."


</p><p data-p-id="766d681a5552c617fbc2eae79feb9522">Eustaf tried to whistle, but it didn't blow well. He clenched his teeth and roughly found the whistle and asked.


</p><p data-p-id="c1ff66f963bd5bff2f33002eff8b39c1">Piip-


</p><p data-p-id="483539f7f98a2d592ad3b18e2651a2cf">A sharp sound spread through the cold air. Soon after, knights on horseback appeared.


</p><p data-p-id="ccc3bae3d44d22ffeec6289537bbd987">"Ran?"


</p><p data-p-id="0b1c5fa1169e7e14c8bff6b522fbef41">Everyone bowed their heads with a dark face when asked by Eustaf. Then there was a faint sound of shouting over there. <br>Eustaf sped up without saying a word. Around the middle, the bushes were white, so he had to leave his horse behind.


</p><p data-p-id="19ce91a2047c5276da3f1afd9812b9d7">Eustaf ran forward without taking care of the horse.


</p><p data-p-id="e1d965c0635e3960bea3ca92f6158866">"Here you are!"


</p><p data-p-id="2d1a9ee36db6280fe5a385bf38546ff2">Eustaf saw Lan in Ross' arms. <br>A saggy body White face. <br>Stained blood. <br>It was a sensation of feet falling into the ground. Feels like she's picking at the heart with a knife, Eustaf couldn't breathe. <br>I don't even know how she got there.


</p><p data-p-id="f70d123a04de1453142596cb151195da">"She's still breathing!"


</p><p data-p-id="f3cd4ff88edb290a35903cc4b7dd3f47">Only when Ross shouted so, Eustaf let out his breath. He held Lan in his arms as if he had taken her away. Lan drooped like a weak doll. Ross said in surprise.


</p><p data-p-id="d3f1b3cd01584b1573e117535e7235b2">"I think she hurt her head, so if you treat it like that-"


</p><p data-p-id="bc2597669ca9feff4b1f41b1fe074754">"Ran? Ran?"


</p><p data-p-id="1cd5fafb689772bf8b4bdb0764df8658">Eustaf whispered to Lan as if he could not hear Ross.


</p>

<p data-p-id="4bb45696d8084648e0595c4f841071ad">"Lord!"


</p><p data-p-id="cf6c1da1394c85f813e7c923033a6e69">Ross clenched his teeth and grabbed Eustaf by the shoulder.


</p><p data-p-id="9328fa655a5986e0465b7741c8ae60c2">"Wake up! We need to show the Count to the healer right now!" <br>Eustaf paused.


</p><p data-p-id="3423e83f35dea2574e6998daab77ca1d">Lan's thin breath grazed his ear. Eustaf said. <br>"Make a stretcher."


</p><p data-p-id="65f2579ab5d371f7ed1115f921cdbd75">"Master!"


</p><p data-p-id="6292dc5dd902cb81eca66be27d2aa460">Lumiere's running face was also pale. Ross said, "She's still alive," and pulled Lumiere, "Let's make a stretcher." The cape was taken off and a stretcher was made in an instant.


</p><p data-p-id="615782bde7dc825c99ac5e9cc35c6f4a">Fixing Lan's head, the knights moved her in perfect order. Eustaf walked beside her and confirmed Lan's breath several times. <br>It was winter, so whenever she breathed, white steam gushed out, and it felt like her lifeline. <br>As soon as I arrived at the Sky mansion, there was a big commotion.


</p><p data-p-id="e5da0be71e34d4e1a832f31bcd3124b0">After putting Lan on the bed, the maids took off her clothes and pushed the men out, and only the therapist went inside. <br>Standing in the living room, Eustaf and Lumiere listened nervously to the sound of the room.


</p><p data-p-id="305dd2c57a1844d42a5b7a91aa8221f9">"Ahhhhhhhhhhh!"


</p><p data-p-id="1fffe14c67e24f7fb380e19cec3945d7">A sudden scream from the inside sent Eustaf kicking in the door.


</p><p data-p-id="288e6cfbcc03df13bd76e89e88ed2faa">"Ran!!"


</p><p data-p-id="97a6ca7489d7651e06b85e6029f84a31">Lan, dressed in white negligee, was huddling and sobbing. Dimodia hurriedly covered her with her body and shouted.


</p><p data-p-id="338984b3fbdf8b06fbcb08298aec6404">"Get out!"


</p><p data-p-id="89e0cfffcec66095136b8dc94b357407">Kiri ran over and pushed Eustaf away.


</p><p data-p-id="c36ff2e14d53eff402c09a2e2d43fe5d">"I just hit the dislocated arm."


</p><p data-p-id="f6627ddbbdcb893ff5b05c7c41bb7262">There was a spark in Eustaf's eyes. Kiri said face to face without avoiding his eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="2760257bdbe5c3d9dbf2992c0dc4405b">"She's lucky she's still alive, even though she fell from that high place. She have bruises all over her body and frostbite, but it's not too much. I guess she got her arm out, but she don't seem to have broken anywhere." Eustaf exhaled his trembling breath.


</p><p data-p-id="07afb5e8dc5f084ceda0bc1cec3f5785">I couldn't think straight at all. <br>He spoke low, pointing at his forehead.


</p><p data-p-id="2ed344b51123020237a10aa3a6228431">"Then is she okay now?"


</p><p data-p-id="8c6aa11ee228662b94385d3d42cf83aa">"No"


</p><p data-p-id="16b0b93d3907eece90a16bff2fc48cea">He looked at her at Kiri's words.


</p><p data-p-id="09ddca96514e0c28b1c78f3dbb7b77c1">"Then?"

</p><p data-p-id="bde743cce3d9a3defe94d60e9764e1ce">"-!!"


</p><p data-p-id="68ed6b6d1cf91fae3e54a93a9946db77">Eustaf swallowed his breath. A silence that seemed to be heard even the sound of needles pressed down on the living room.


</p><p data-p-id="081bfa9457cd59411cf90359ead5a60a">He asked after a long silence. <br>"What are the chances of recovery?"<br><br>"Well, I don't know. Maybe it's because of the head trauma, but the therapist seems to be thinking. We'll have to wait and see."


</p><p data-p-id="c3938697091fedccc55ce444280708f8">"All right" <br>Eustaf replied briefly.


</p><p data-p-id="346c0b4d02c356ef4b17e7397b9c9e26">Kiri spoke cautiously when she saw him looking too subdued. <br>"I'm going back inside. I'll let you know when things get better."


</p><p data-p-id="529144bfcc4ef29bbcb769958aebb01f">When she went back into the bedroom, Yustaf raised his fist and tried to hit the wall, but he paused and got off. <br>If there's a loud noise, Lan's gonna be surprised. <br>He closed his eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="38afdf08e7a6a241eb09e84a0c570735">'I promised you, you'd be safe.' I didn't.


</p><p data-p-id="eab6430ec5c72ec1de89e48e15200a03">I shouldn't have left her outside. <br>I should have taken her inside. I should have kept it within eye contact. <br>I was afraid of Lan because of the sound I heard last time, so I left her outside in case it happened again.


</p><p data-p-id="65b51c0030caf79580be3ec7ee236713">'Masu.'


</p><p data-p-id="772f14fd514771822b307a627c287113">Something black seemed to eat himself. I think someone is picking at his chest with a knife.


</p><p data-p-id="0fb9674557410549ec186d76fd3b191d">What does Lan say? <br>Even if she said she would leave Lazia right away, he had nothing to say. <br>Do you want to curse or blame me? <br>It was painful like swallowing a piece of ice every time I breathed. <br>It was surprising that the pain of the heart could also be physically present.


</p><p data-p-id="569db35142922eaa9caf5d2b816c173e">Eustaf opened his eyes thinking so. <br>The seal took a long time. <br>The blue flame burned at a slower pace than before, and the ceremony proceeded slowly. <br>Something is going on. <br>I knew something dangerous was happening.


</p><p data-p-id="127a6d9457007e7b7d7762b57f0412d3">'But I can't let you go.'


</p><p data-p-id="e06f5e74854cfbd589bd5315a9c315e8">In self-praise, Eustaf told Lumiere.<br><br>"Is she the one who asked Lan to save?"


</p><p data-p-id="4aee693235e381b93bcd6506e475436a">"Yes, she asked me to treat her like a guest."


</p><p data-p-id="5e2793d85dd1b5b3ee8fdbd194bc7d5e">Lumiere answered quietly. Eustaf could easily see that anger permeated under his tone.


</p><p data-p-id="e5e368d0345f9ee1212386f46d1203b8">It was Eustaf, anger at himself. <br>"Then I beg you."


</p><p data-p-id="1cffdbeb529ebe4fb69613a2c104a60a">At Eustaf's words, Lumiere saw him with scarlet eyes and redness, and left the living room without saying a word.
