<p data-p-id="7498f869bbc5e0055d877d525f6f94ab">Regend, the first wizard of the round table and chairman of the wizard association, greeted with a smile.

</p><p data-p-id="f391f5131d9ca028a478a93e325d220b">"Long time no see. Lord, I think we should call you Count Romia now. I think you're more beautiful than you were."

</p><p data-p-id="e2d7d5636df1a7ec90c34aa91802e01d">Lan also smiled and greeted Regend politely.

</p><p data-p-id="71387c6f8979ebbf4374923c07cf9763">"I haven't seen you in a long time. Mr. Regend has not changed."

</p><p data-p-id="e259e0117ef00482c72466e3f5d07b44">"The only news I hear in Lazia is always exciting, so this old man comes alive."

</p><p data-p-id="97c5afa3e0fad4fbc0cd03d300cb0a4c">"The news from the Wizard's Association also brings joy to Lazia."

</p><p data-p-id="211c07f0ca3641b076a849d3dff269e2">Regend went inside under Lan's guidance, thinking that she was still a good talker who didn't say a word.

</p><p data-p-id="bda2b0a8fd23e831d0e304cba598fa83">He just said, according to aristocratic usage,

</p><p data-p-id="bfc591341d3f229a811825fb45f9d310">"You keep getting into trouble. What's wrong with you?"

</p><p data-p-id="7bac790772e729b32d7250a9e24746d6">Lan's rebuttal was, <br>"Is that gonna be like the Wizard's Association?"

</p><p data-p-id="e6414793b652a5da71d0eeec50e1e809">'It's a coincidence.'

</p><p data-p-id="ca3f753d3bbc154c7523606ce23a84f6">Entering the second drawing room, Sina jumped up from her seat with a very nervous face.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p data-p-id="98e870bde1fd392a608c960391212d82">Sina mumbled when she saw Regend.

</p><p data-p-id="06ba9d7a5e5b636227a54b6e16813187">"Gandalf 路路路路."

</p><p data-p-id="db4ba2c4c80f0e4ed0861b57f395e0b0">Lan looked at Regend again, wondering 'Is that so?' It seems that the long white beard is similar to that of...

</p><p data-p-id="70e1b4086ef25247a8ee7a7e43cea5f5">"Cough."

</p><p data-p-id="875d9cfafba4f9e87cdddae2905cb3b8">Regend coughed in vain, so Lan quickly introduced it.

</p><p data-p-id="57c4e1f47ce0812e8ac63aff10018234">"This is Regend, president of the Wizard Association. And this is Ishina, a valued guest from another world, whose last name is Lee."

</p><p data-p-id="78f936fbf08d04e993419b07f386456b">"You can just call me Sina."

</p><p data-p-id="a8a26ff8a1e6f133fa6ca69770f2d32b">Sina said so and greeted lightly, and Regend also patted his beard and greeted each other face to face.

</p><p data-p-id="22b319626b7d35b7b8e836b516cbfd19">"I heard you're from another world."

</p><p data-p-id="dec19e0691c228131baa1d6baa4debf4">"Yes."

</p><p data-p-id="107c058374b6e6139082ce5be4e03272">Sina nodded her head and Regend's eyes shone. He said, waving his cane.

</p><p data-p-id="0d7120edee5957463e4b64d7ddf64c33">"Can I take a test for a while?"

</p><p data-p-id="82ec1870bdc2a034ad8062c95978d75d">"Is it sick?"

</p><p data-p-id="b6bee0c53a1e6c543912b3037daec80c">Regend shook his head at Sina's question.

</p><p data-p-id="4d4264ce82aea371ce3e99dc8d893397">"No, I can't hurt Lazia's precious guest. I'm just taking a peek."

</p><p data-p-id="03ab61158f4b3d14c1681c51bebaa681">"Okay then."

</p><p data-p-id="c7beb82cab67e22cc22d256d81cc2f37">Sina nodded, and Regend waved his wand lightly. Lan also looked closely at his wand because it was his first time seeing a wizard using magic.

</p><p data-p-id="d9d4a7da9674f3f87bdeacf3f9422adf">A small magic image was drawn and a twinkling light fell on Sina's head.

</p><p data-p-id="214d37bd76132c61a62aa2ee8a4484ee">"Wow-"

</p><p data-p-id="995bcd5787be30a27eaa23ef7ba77784">Sina exclaimed and saw the light powder falling on her body.

</p><p data-p-id="368fec412ba01056a351710c1cf3712c">"Oh-what will it be?"

</p><p data-p-id="b21fcb1ee23fe702e7549b8ccbdc02fe">Regend nodded and said to Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="3d80d53c2728758a01599c0f7d5b160c">"The Earl should touch it."

</p><p data-p-id="3372ef01f016b6c7f239c45ee29480c5">When Lan reached out her hand carefully and touched the powder, it clung to Lan's arm.

</p><p data-p-id="c393de6f6c4bf710ebb2c5ee8b1f2f1e">"Oh my?"

</p><p data-p-id="7763750ae3107fd029347bd17f20f52d">Lan slapped her hand in surprise, but the light still glittered and glittered away as if it had seeped into her arms. Sina looked at her arm.

</p><p data-p-id="3b93b0e8623c655c4aa99b415d7e455d">The powder didn't stick to her and just dripped down.

</p><p data-p-id="ee9ff4727175083e79f23c41f21bb940">"This is the magic of the world. Sina can't relate to this mana. You're really from another world."

</p>

<p data-p-id="35a9055d00b897c2f96d5b0349be597b">Lan saw the powder seeped into her arm.

</p><p data-p-id="da1397d1faff0a9281ba55a59e4daa53">I'm really a man of this world now.

</p><p data-p-id="7cc6e88a9b57b8ac9be63f66580e22d1">"Then it's proven, right? Is there no way to go back to the original world? Yes?"

</p><p data-p-id="0374c5a0115f32d82e12d2cccfee5d36">"There is no magic beyond the dimension, and even if there is, there is no magic to do it." Regend shook his head.

</p><p data-p-id="3332ce985a74fa4b9f1e643e0eaae9ce">"If you're the Great Sage, you wouldn't know."

</p><p data-p-id="ce8c7ab1c0787871f1c858c360ac3960">"Iveria."

</p><p data-p-id="292123a69e468d3d7cf736409ebd8d3c">Sina's black eyes shone as if they were burning short.

</p><p data-p-id="23dcb8c8a053650d4620bffc4819be0e">"Can I go back if she's there?"

</p><p data-p-id="cff56869d64b2bc49f12e4bd6645719e">"Mrs. Sina."

</p><p data-p-id="e32e7018b32b06d46012246ec7f80322">Regent Sadly said, <br>"But she doesn't already exist."

</p><p data-p-id="9c2c6dfdb2ad04f5ce5869b8d4445c06">"What about the person who brought me here? He'd brought me here, so he can send me back, right?" Regend said embarrassedly.

</p><p data-p-id="535b4cdf991ba8bf548a0067c7cd787c">"Well, maybe it's possible. Do you know who did that?"

</p><p data-p-id="011c2732fc69141da78288b62fbe9876">When Regend said, Sina bit her lips and said,

</p><p data-p-id="2efd476d87aaac9f2c83c14f14aa063a">"The monster behind the door."

</p><p data-p-id="0e3ac327768cdda2ff857bb3f5d98244">"What the--"

</p><p data-p-id="76c91ea1cded373d9d9c80da0ec51232">Regend frowned and Lan shook her head and said.

</p><p data-p-id="1c70615cd0761301b8e467b495433ae3">"Can you keep what I'm telling you now as a secret?"

</p><p data-p-id="4385ba3804a94cccd468b82c57d15abe">"I swear on my word."

</p><p data-p-id="6e73ef8d8f613b0f328baee16955a1e7">As Regend spoke seriously, Lan talked about liberal arts and Delphanto.

</p><p data-p-id="1de45f890d76892657885bc297cfc556">Regend groaned.

</p><p data-p-id="a95f8db3b966370649a032dca0e7a52b">"I see.....That's why the great wise man..."

</p><p data-p-id="b21ac48d48fc6883a311b4a0c7706242">Regend spoke seriously. <br>"The Wizard Association also has several records of the great sage. And so is the record of the door. The first wizard is Ibria."

</p><p data-p-id="92b9296bc6a20f42520b18384ae8547b">Lan's eyes glistened. <br>"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="7ef9bc369f8d470b723a6f3ac41b9b23">"Yes, we were also wondering what the great wise man meant to keep out of Lacia."

</p><p data-p-id="d14582b633fd6c5035c40c649b699075">Laughing, Regend laughed. Wizards are a collection of curiosity, so they persistently investigated the ice wall and the door.

</p><p data-p-id="f30bb4499a195729f1fc5696926d218d">Regend stroked his beard. After the ice crystal was discovered, Lazia became a hot potato again and rose and fell among wizards, and old studies were excavated again.

</p><p data-p-id="4d36b74c2529577789894707be8157bd">Regend has read dozens of such research books.

</p><p data-p-id="e0efdf81883e3774946b5ccda9dca079">"It's already well known among wizards to seal the black dragon inside the door. He said he was a Dragon with great power, so it was all he could do to do. I also saw some plans to create a magic of inquiry. I don't think it's going to be a complete product."

</p><p data-p-id="5b5647704a79a9c76eb2d9a65989513a">"Then is there a way to re-seal it?"

</p><p data-p-id="8a978ff122a80483add841077636e463">Lan asked him in a hurry without realizing it, so Regend was lost in thought.

</p><p data-p-id="314518274f7a4d7c4587b6abe08b47a2">"I think we should look at that again. I can't give you a definite answer."

</p><p data-p-id="b35f638e8642a4f7ae0316b5f939161b">"Please do it again."

</p><p data-p-id="66232093b5fba9a141d065f606b97655">Sina looked at Lan and said quietly.

</p><p data-p-id="ec2e85cfd4c8d339325f15dcdd689b0d">"And the way I can go back."

</p><p data-p-id="5048dfd5b6f3c6845ed93f184b4d9a2e">Regend looked back at Sina and smiled kindly.

</p><p data-p-id="12887be0a02b4ce6931e2103f2f46720">"Of course. I'll look into it again."

</p><p data-p-id="91bdd53ecf9f44626b49d1f5a8aa5edf">Sina nodded and said.

</p><p data-p-id="c05d45df74ba6fe27700e9557ef95859">"I'll do whatever it takes to do that. Feel free to tell me if you need my blood or hair."

</p><p data-p-id="7859192c5ff159daa6cada6e552b8938">Regend blinked at the words.

</p><p data-p-id="4b009b5fa534be1812fba5c9a068c7da">"Do you need that to use magic? What magic do you use....?"

</p><p data-p-id="e6533768ef50d2db966ea5ad25da3948">When asked by him, Sina panicked and asked back, "Oh, no?" Regend shook his head.

</p>

<p data-p-id="0dd53b84448ea63cccb8ee9b735719e7">"What magic do you cast with human flesh and blood?"

</p><p data-p-id="7a3a99c499a317a794968ac90149761d">With an incomprehensible look on her face, Sina stretched her shoulders, saying,

</p><p data-p-id="73e20e37615f849de04f297b1b007b79">"I see......"

</p><p data-p-id="d15927491030d25b232d2bcd0f24e79b">It must be different from the magic you thought.

</p><p data-p-id="929a443e9ca6066423af36170893a712">"Do they use flesh and blood? How do I write this?"

</p><p data-p-id="340e51c7566e039d3bc906c14e412e10">Regend asked with a curious face, and Sina shook her hand.

</p><p data-p-id="5ae1b820226ebe8bf87f4265b518893b">"No, we don't have magic. But there's a rumor about a wizard....."

</p><p data-p-id="afcd847535d8a62268726ffc8b9ed68f">"That's a bad rumor. Wizards get caught up in all sorts of bad rumors."

</p><p data-p-id="c10cf925d276dbd56d4a32f4f75db904">Regend kicked his tongue and shook her head. Sina was thankful that the story went over moderately.

</p><p data-p-id="d00e5befd17a964dd38f95efe4ce1d44">Regend peeked at Lan and said, <br>"You don't have to worry too much about that rumor. It's a rumor made by little people."

</p><p data-p-id="c44290f967cccdb4afd497230c9e1032">Lan looked at his head.

</p><p data-p-id="124f83d6cad24e4b94121f46e8b35baa">"What's the rumor?"

</p><p data-p-id="6a0ba594c4e6bb76b735fe5a7dbd97d4">Regend laughed and said at her question.

</p><p data-p-id="dc1ca708d1cbeda184ded21e83c25a30">"It's a rumor. It's always spinning. Then I'll be on my way."

</p><p data-p-id="a0834755e9621bffe539e28af035e528">Then, leaving the mansion in a hurry, Lan squinted and saw him off.

</p><p data-p-id="83ffdbf11241c0a429cea98307ab9df0">'Rumor? What rumor?'

</p><p data-p-id="132182226c8544851d55f233151c4231">If Regend is so direct about it, the rumors are pretty wide spread.

</p><p data-p-id="4d1d9dd5d9ff3dccdc1949aaa4ffabf3">Lan thought about whether to rob Kiri or to visit Riz茅e, and decided to rob a more gentle Kiri.

</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******

</p><p data-p-id="f32ba4492a14b314dfd86168abc641c5">"Rumor-?"

</p><p data-p-id="6ab805e22f05e9e4a835634035c3e6c7">Holding the tail of the word long, Kiri blinked her eyes. Lan spoke coldly.

</p><p data-p-id="c957ba86bd7adea05ea8ede102620ac1">"If Nok-young doesn't know the rumor that the wizard knows, I'll have to reconsider the budget."

</p><p data-p-id="1dc22f5a588d741308db2759e2d5129f">At her words, Kiri let out a ball and groaned and crushed her shoulder.

</p><p data-p-id="f84ad98f3cb21ad1c9dc96e95ecad6fb">"It's not a big rumor."

</p><p data-p-id="7e2eef02705810cb2029054646a535d5">"Or there's no reason not to tell me any more."

</p><p data-p-id="f68bd1fb44ef1c1b2505ffe2b0c5a43b">There was nothing wrong with Lan's words, so she added it while Kiri was pondering.

</p><p data-p-id="f67bdbaa61f12c0d95d8346b8ce4171d">"I won't say that Kiri said it."

</p><p data-p-id="5775dd48d42f53cc5e87eab93e4c46cb">"Aha, if you do."

</p><p data-p-id="70e2ea22fc004c1ed804df1692dee4c4">Kiri grinned like a fox and said after she rubbed her palm.

</p><p data-p-id="103a0c62413ffd5f852c6ef22be49e34">"There are rumors that Mrs Lan was the mistress of Emperor Ruth."

</p><p data-p-id="ccd2705c50af15f4b46bde93f78e4ba2">".....What?"

</p><p data-p-id="b593cef55e1b9fd5ba3ded18880200e7">"So you got pregnant and rushed down to Lazia?"

</p><p data-p-id="8d07c8f89813256c03da8d85aaf0935e">"Isn't the timing not right.....?"

</p><p data-p-id="3fbc23518495697c0c6a3528aee62a27">"You've taken the trouble out of Lazia, and with that technology, you've captured the Duke and made him engaged."

</p><p data-p-id="c15ff42cc40603390e574301710a03ff">Lan opened her mouth wide. <br>Kiri looked down on her shoulders and said comfortably to Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="e83c29eb0ef4a7686f1ecbde8b544695">"Don't worry too much."

</p><p data-p-id="c31ece0cbb5927d4a56fa63128e1361a">"No, the quality of the rumors is so dirty, isn't it? How can you not care about this? Who in the world would say such a rumor....."

</p><p data-p-id="fadc3207f3b2af7504d8f4dddb38dccd">"As you said, it's a very malicious rumor. It's not just a rumor, it's someone who made it. And."

</p><p data-p-id="7eb9fbe024701897000a3f241b9a7dfb">Kiri tilted her head. Her eyes became thinner, too.

</p><p data-p-id="2590ffac0fcbe45f34330f7d890d8ebd">"Jealous people easily spread the rumor from mouth to mouth. I don't know who started the rumor."

</p><p data-p-id="b34cc4b2fbc8d4e520aa8f5182da00da">I would never do anything to offend the Duke.

</p><p data-p-id="d45cd2facce4efbf7719d03e41fc7bbc">Kiri swallowed the backstabbing and told Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="8df3fbd510c056065c243542a249fe6d">"There's not a full-fledged rumor yet. It's obviously a rumor."

</p><p data-p-id="f72dcd419aa6fed35d26c868e4d24a17">"But the bumps go around."

</p><p data-p-id="6bc696f71c4ab5c51668510e0f09b8b6">"That's right."

</p><p data-p-id="0ed75c199051a7705565d423b5dac538">Kiri grinned and said,

</p><p data-p-id="d9ff260ceb26d2c3b30b7364d746eeee">"You're popular," and Lan pointed on her forehead.

</p><p data-p-id="323f5a3fb09cdaccfaf832fa8afe98c1">"It's not me, it's Youth."

</p><p data-p-id="f3066ea4ba64f4bdf456679228ffcf55">"Minus popularity is also popular."

</p><p data-p-id="bd51ee79aab4e06bd6b0f38108fa67da">Ho-ho laughed and Kiri said it wasn't her job, and she said coolly and went away, and Ran sighed.

</p><p data-p-id="60e31f74a5b96fdf62fc2a54eb7fc693">'If I had asked Dimodia, I would have been comforted.'

</p><p data-p-id="2ca63e2bf2a7870b0c318974b9832784">Well, I know that all that consolation is useless.

</p><p data-p-id="5a2471dc6282c0c713f6f99c17167ceb">'But who the hell started such a malicious rumor?'

</p><p data-p-id="d85b53c10acc4b8f416147008acef886">Lan was organizing her enemies in her head, and thought,

</p><p data-p-id="cd097f8d3e53e6363303a335de5b9489">"Should we just question them one by one?"

</p><p data-p-id="ac56a8dab70c704c59c33dea94a233f6">Even in the reality of the development of SNS, if you question one by one,

</p><p data-p-id="2af3ce81b684b4b079938bc709350055">"Who talked about it?" you will eventually arrive at the epicenter.

</p><p data-p-id="382fce16d813303ffffe3d12a0c43b63">There is even no anonymous bulletin board here. But her worries were futile.

</p><p data-p-id="2d1267d9de320bbe98ea20e96910c5d9">Elise, whom I met shortly after, spoke with round eyes.

</p><p data-p-id="7c0703d37a1dbf5ca30bda82585fe1a4">"I know who that is."

</p><p data-p-id="53402ad348f3c23cb3113f37c7a8d4e8">"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="58d2688793f4d42f7f2d6e72bf9cedaa">When asked back in surprise, Elise nodded and put a spoonful of chocolate mousse cake in her mouth with a polite touch.

</p><p data-p-id="ce3675209e4135fe150f7324c4ec1e26">"Oh, my God! How do you make this?"

</p><p data-p-id="52a1e74bbfd91fbfcbd44a5d2e91d847">"Well."

</p><p data-p-id="fc71fc6ad4b6c91b9858d150fcc6b47d">"Ran Romia."

</p><p data-p-id="7660971c28aa9340e87b7200c6012745">"Tell me more. So who is it? Who the hell is talking about that? Is she the Lady of Marquis Cameron? Or-"

</p><p data-p-id="4502bd6189fd5aed01dfca7f9c0a2723">Elise blinked her dark amber eyes and said after taking another bite of mousse cake.

</p><p data-p-id="5076d0dfef1c774807bf20e463fa02df">"The Lady of Baroness Chlo茅."

</p><p data-p-id="ce22ec674147157534af31bddbeed1f4">"......who is that....?"

</p><p data-p-id="b0696522bbda8c60262bec6d50688d52">Lan became embarrassed.

</p><p data-p-id="d7b31e723643767278a3fcc133dea804">It wasn't a name I'd heard of anywhere, not a name I'd seen.

</p><p data-p-id="7edc07e6ef0c957469be1a9e45918839">"Uh-um, don't you think Lan no needs to worry?"

</p><p data-p-id="57bae4b8928d186985f8ad4dad3c4369">Elise smiled and said, so Lan frowned.

</p><p data-p-id="376210998a20569c59aa9afd109570e5">"I'm not worried-- i'am upset, am I? Besides, who the hell is that? I've never heard of her before."

</p><p data-p-id="92d51e44b8c2b8bf9df20f3e9ff67782">"If I were to make a prediction-"

</p><p data-p-id="b0da88583a53efdf59f26874456c4264">Elise spoke with a deep voice after a test to look into the crystal ball.

</p><p data-p-id="7bf2d14f4104faa596823336e1de0551">"Let's see, I think it'll be settled the day after tomorrow."

</p><p data-p-id="f590320fb4346e74f75e8d40e5d003b9">"What? Why? What? What do you know?"

</p><p data-p-id="c6df085f027cbfdf21b510fbf2e45883">"It's a secret. Oh, this is really good. Are you going to put it in this tea party?"

</p><p data-p-id="824628b39fc4e21d983c6c5f3f147e24">"How else did you know about the tea party?"

</p><p data-p-id="209f670aba8f231ce66a37b601e26f6a">"Why don't I know, there's a lot of attention on the green arch right now. Even businesses coming in and out of this place are the main targets of observation."

</p><p data-p-id="136f6162ef2208d2d77d952b7d20d813">"I can't believe it 路路路路路路."

</p><p data-p-id="6c3af537834fe3479926ae8ffb78f4c8">"Better than that, Katya, the Empress is attending a garden party?"

</p><p data-p-id="cf2fb720ff33ab5cc1c4a84cc92546c7">"Yes."

</p><p data-p-id="019d2047a4ceae3410ba43ba81293182">"Are you coming with Eustaf?"

</p><p data-p-id="0fb2b4ba976c708f8c350509fd700059">"No, it's a day party. And I don't think Empress Dowager wants to see Youth now." Lan shook her hand.

</p><p data-p-id="d578eb62c2fa8a8ecf3ebef1f3f8bf8c">"Well, that's true."

</p><p data-p-id="5e3674f6b7bd184b635b0d513971754b">Elise agreed. You probably don't want to see anyone your son's age. <br>Besides, no one knows that Ruth and Eustaf were at odds.

</p><p data-p-id="af797b4f44db338d2f12786f052587b5">'But isn't that the same with Lan?'

</p><p data-p-id="a03ef949053e8b490f90379b2a2d48b1">Elise suddenly looked at Lan with that thought. She is also a person who did not let her dead son Ruth go even though he was hanging like that.

</p><p data-p-id="e27c30acadac0d12bec14736dd9023ff">It's weird that it's a person's heart, so when the target dies, it'll be glorified.

</p><p data-p-id="ed56ef36709783e4e8541b60a5efc1a8">'I don't know if you meant it in a good way. Or....'

</p><p data-p-id="d27cee8b4ba84acc2c311f28d27ebddd">Elise said.

</p><p data-p-id="c2ee8f298f8d24d4fc9daf1c6c7e16fc">"I'm coming, so let's go together. All right?"

</p><p data-p-id="47e2f278d559e86ae0ddf155d38f023a">Lan nodded and laughed at Elise's words.

</p><p data-p-id="c910fb0fbb3b364e9b35a8020f76e33c">"Okay, I won't leave you."
