<p data-p-id="b8926e7bc24ded2a05d68382d8e1bf45">After the kiss, Eustaf told Lan, who had dyed her face red.

</p><p data-p-id="bf58c5013f2602658fdd184b43f0fe3a">"Then the prophecy was already wrong when Lan came to visit me at the Academy. There is no way that I will fall in love with another woman now. If the future is unclear, wouldn't it be possible to change it for the better?"

</p><p data-p-id="4ab998b30ccb1c13c6a053be209959e4">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="66152826be3529754b7abed757137bb4">Lan nodded softly, and Yustaf hugged Lan in a relaxed mood.

</p><p data-p-id="86fe05681d6191e9e73ed6f23079f551">"I was really worried. I'm afraid Lan's mind has changed."

</p><p data-p-id="924fe69525ca9f41b2260534ade1d469">"I'm sorry."

</p><p data-p-id="b8821f4704b16ec81e24e412252c6272">Now that I confess everything and think about it in Eustaf arms, Lan's face was burning with embarrassment.

</p><p data-p-id="a4a3a828bf8e5a30c7a832b03d8724b1">"I heard what maid said t me."

</p><p data-p-id="5701f0e7279bec04eccfa158af512d92">At Lan's words, Eustaf asked, "Really?" Lan nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="9f17a7e758bb4eaf731e4f475ac4041a">"They asked me if I was going to leave."

</p><p data-p-id="a475cc64d4c293fadf25a26c9fa14b80">Eustaf held her tight and said.

</p><p data-p-id="0664a098d9b9abf61d7bbb06f5ba03cb">"So, were you really going to do that?"

</p><p data-p-id="f2ff13d7d4ccbbe6f827829262e42f4e">Lan rolled her eyes in his arms and spoke frankly.

</p><p data-p-id="1a0ceb7935bc827c6efec6a972f10404">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="0b0421632e10f11ca0cfcaf60d7c6574">Eustaf was so full that he lifted her face and said,

</p><p data-p-id="67693a6990647881f2684a0752f76906">"What were you going to do out of Lazia?"

</p><p data-p-id="eef652ea38bd849c7b76d375f468425a">What are you going to do out of here without any money?

</p><p data-p-id="93ff252ec0c199b6714c789a495c03a2">I didn't want her to run away, but I hated it even more when she went somewhere and suffered.

</p><p data-p-id="66f1cbf52cd7c2e395860c129adeab87">Lan said, Since I'm being honest, I'm going to be honest. "I have a certain identity."

</p><p data-p-id="232dc531c2359952fd175b164262c390">His eyes narrowed.

</p><p data-p-id="cf293129d428eee698f74440f93bfe84">"What?"

</p><p data-p-id="58433617b6f8245a5cf470249283a531">"Uh, for the run...I had a separate identity, so I tried to use it."

</p><p data-p-id="73df839cd6a2e4234174108649300031">"When does it start?"

</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="3adf730ff59e8ee502b6c332bb78460b">"When did you start to have that identity?"

</p><p data-p-id="d7db14e221b7be3256e692ba9cd8e421">His voice was as smooth and soft as silk.

</p><p data-p-id="66b88414893871fd6ebcfec2c6262827">"I've been thinking from the beginning. Is it when Eustaf's coming-of-age ceremony is just around the corner?"

</p><p data-p-id="b667752697b2e6aa4b1218b16dbe91fa">Eustaf groaned briefly.

</p><p data-p-id="4eaf1943cee4395804df99698c7a5ce3">"I'm glad Noonim drunk."

</p><p data-p-id="817387bec6ae65d31c3123439540966a">"Huh? Drunk?"

</p><p data-p-id="e6c82fb00c3325e3a45ab4e8a63418e9">What are you saying all of a sudden?

</p><p data-p-id="5b060c42f8d7691c903478996ccb716d">"Didn't you get drunk that day and tell me the terms? Actually, I was going to talk to you in a little while-"

</p><p data-p-id="426c3efae191208c0bcec940a70089d1">He glanced at Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="d5cec626096b9119733cc654a6f0d87b">"One day, Lan could have disappeared without knowing it."

</p><p data-p-id="d9949439f741aa1df95b64cfe5391d97">"Sure."

</p><p data-p-id="2d319605d7fab1432d190dae58da9e03">Lan laughed snugly.

</p><p data-p-id="d18fcc908c7c9881ecc00889619f301b">"Good timing."

</p><p data-p-id="6b13a78c3711f269a85abf72367af95f">Eustaf groaned again. Lan is smiling lightly right now, but it's not just about that, but it's all about his-

</p><p data-p-id="32085a672e396b9cf21c3153a9558bac">'Everything.'

</p><p data-p-id="8cafe86b31609fe82f101fbcb5644a8e">Eustaf stopped thinking.

</p><p data-p-id="facb19019c17b8c1db2f0f58f5b61dd8">He blinked in front of his eyes and looked up at Lan with a smile on his face, 'Why?'

</p><p data-p-id="53a889b8f9d89032a6882ce5fa63ae32">Since when did she become his 'all'?

</p><p data-p-id="3028cf2e4e76617fc64b9869ebed9b63">Since when did my Lachia become Lan?

</p><p data-p-id="b36c7f48dd433044b2ff3f1fe5b5e6d4">Somehow I laughed, and Eustaf leaned on her.

</p><p data-p-id="d316a43023fe92eb7d04bc4403ded33f">"Really."

</p><p data-p-id="a73819a9d1eaba373bc5b081eec76050">"Youth?"

</p><p data-p-id="62f63b23bd260ddf4b4e5cbf09426e1d">"No, it's nothing."

</p><p data-p-id="98aa3cbc9bdfcf2df36b33c7a719125a">Then suddenly, the room became dark at once. Did Lan turn off the lights? Then I looked around without realizing it, and Eustaf got up from his seat and approached the window.

</p>

<p data-p-id="2f77c8ce963f7ae53748c9da7ed12437">He swallowed a groan.

</p><p data-p-id="aee36cd12e7595e752fdd65b4f1485c2">"What? Why is it suddenly dark?"

</p><p data-p-id="188e9961616f067fa3a61d5e8ed8746b">Lan looked at the window, saying so, and suddenly her vision turned white.

</p><p data-p-id="1488b99aa50432dd33ebe596a84be5f4">Lan opened her mouth wide.

</p><p data-p-id="6a531f7e49cb879ccc6e110439d1f544">"Snowstorm!"

</p><p data-p-id="37a1bcfddef3cf2cb545b76d47f1f7f0">She shouted, ran to the door without realizing it, opened the door, and felt her body follow the door mate. The strong wind followed the door opening, accompanied by Lan holding the handle. Eustaf grabbed it and dragged it inside and closed the door.

</p><p data-p-id="d927600f7a5ec2bbe4cb921c41457ded">Bump!

</p><p data-p-id="1c054d85c9cc8c96d0d5dd902a5e31a0">The door closed with a loud noise and Lan gasped.

</p><p data-p-id="9f77eeb578320a33b47ca5f1cecc5664">In the meantime, snow already came indoors and piled up in the corner.

</p><p data-p-id="542cff5a00b8012d7c1397217e09b73e">"Wha, what, what do we do?"

</p><p data-p-id="108395c8e37d5d73b35e4adaafabf28e">Lan said in a trembling voice. I felt the temperature drop in the cabin suddenly.

</p><p data-p-id="b1b62f7c61d861c6265cbcb7704c5787">Eustaf closed all the shutters of the cabin and turned on the lamp.

</p><p data-p-id="3bdf6e2340f27d94ad6034385f264df0">The loud sound of shaking windows and doors and the howling wind came together.

</p><p data-p-id="2146e4d254d94109dad0d2e678f20739">"We'll wait until the storm stops."

</p><p data-p-id="b2cccd7a7e7b82fb99fd8341e97f20d1">He turned his eyes to the ice crystal piled up neatly like firewood.

</p><p data-p-id="fa75426fb7052d548e41aa8108b681ed">"It will last at least three or four days." Lan sighed.

</p><p data-p-id="936407f2179e1cf74464f3fb80f7cf45">"I'm so glad it's not wood."

</p><p data-p-id="b16982fbb0e5fa28cec5b515fd7c3d2a">"That's a relief."

</p><p data-p-id="aee3e38cb658e20dae741f34475bbd85">Lan took off her clothes and said, <br>"Let's use this to block windows and doors. It would be much better if there was less draft. And this dress is too thick to move around."

</p><p data-p-id="611a19e563d45b0493dfccfcffba2f92">At Lan's words, Eustaf nodded. A scarf, a cape, a fur coat, another coat in it, a cardigan, a sweater, a vest, a shirt.

</p><p data-p-id="45aabefb26544c8bc040cbabc6ac7767">As the two of them were dressed, Lan felt light after taking off all her clothes.

</p><p data-p-id="8058821cf220f9253b6b8342d4f2937e">She even took off her sweater and vest and was dressed in a shirt and a cardigan.

</p><p data-p-id="ff567924afaa8e3a88b4cd53cf453ecc">"Isn't Eustaf cold?"

</p><p data-p-id="7ee0df4cf7277c83bb062bacc1fddebb">"I'm fine."

</p><p data-p-id="44f2b09f305e6f977405ed461f2a4da5">"I didn't ask you if you were okay, but if you weren't cold."

</p><p data-p-id="bae4add53d4beeea41ffe5353315070c">"It's not cold."

</p><p data-p-id="f76b8b29539e212e7ed8b731e6f38682">"How could you not be cold in a coat?!"

</p><p data-p-id="6ad4d4bd062a2e967837da08ca797f87">She asked back like a scream, so Eustaf smirked.

</p><p data-p-id="79c79ed4841a987ba289fcd2daf03e09">"It don't seem to be very cold."

</p><p data-p-id="8b7cfb4462b8053ed6fbf1dbb8c04d01">Eustaf was dressed in a coat, jacket, vest, and shirt.

</p><p data-p-id="6cda4d6e536adf307a73e3bdcc68d60a">I don't know if the vest is furry like his, but it's not.

</p><p data-p-id="d44cffd1791de5d5165d4f9e6fc3bde4">Eustaf adjusted the temperature of the oven higher with his shirt and pants on.

</p><p data-p-id="5b51f24d4104ab51900d7529fadb9c34">The hot wind began to come out strong. Lan also took off her fur gloves and placed them side by side.<br><br>"Isn't that too hot?

</p><p data-p-id="c18e584b946f373c7e1b5ebc82ebf0a4">Eustaf shook his head at Lan's question.

</p><p data-p-id="495df3da1d3c3323974e866fb2e20703">"No, it's just the beginning. It's better to heat up the air in advance."

</p><p data-p-id="53402ad348f3c23cb3113f37c7a8d4e8">"Really?"

</p><p data-p-id="edac46e81ac0e6c32dc0617dfc055551">Lan sighed and approached the fireman.

</p><p data-p-id="e0e03f365133be37dfbba533f949cdf5">"But I'm glad I set it up as a magic artifact."

</p><p data-p-id="cf3dd4f9b8a19eb53c1ef92d54c7572f">"That's a relief. If it were a tree, I wouldn't have thrown it away much."

</p><p data-p-id="fa4be955e6f8ac7cec39796fd8103cda">"I'm in trouble ······."

</p><p data-p-id="a653939e2356bc205170067e18eba78a">Lan murmured and Eustaf asked back, "What do you mean?"

</p><p data-p-id="642b83d175ecfc17a90fca15def099ca">"No, Eustaf's isolated here. Isn't it crazy down there by now? I shouldn't have said they'd come looking for you."

</p>

<p data-p-id="7742f4d8c00ae353d2bbae3ce7359541">"They're not that stupid."

</p><p data-p-id="88765246a2fbb5fb4da99df46160d5e5">Eustaf answered so and brought a blanket and laid it on a wooden chair.

</p><p data-p-id="f87da81e406ba7a0002b5655a823bc31">Lan said, listening to the shaking of the chaps.

</p><p data-p-id="402ef24fe360f29baa3366619783a837">"I hope it stops soon."

</p><p data-p-id="a2db803faa1725515766ce70789bc97a">"Is that so?"

</p><p data-p-id="863155e1882f610bb2f8d6d89c5f23cd">"No?"

</p><p data-p-id="b3573de2bfcd47ace25190881cae40cb">When Lan saw him in surprise, Eustaf smiled faintly.

</p><p data-p-id="281978785ce58d5da2a3b2abc789686f">"It's been a long time since we were alone."

</p><p data-p-id="27ccf226d0ff2ecdff9e78a4598f3eab">Oops, Lan shrugged her shoulders.

</p><p data-p-id="75865beb46bc9004b819aa599611d80b">Eustaf sat on the chair and opened his arms, saying, "Come here," and Lan blushed and hesitated to approach him. Eustaf lightly sat her on the chair and wound her blanket.

</p><p data-p-id="b22cbdbe676179f462515083dafa85d9">"Because I'm always with other people in the house." Lan smiled softly at his words.

</p><p data-p-id="24a1169271c39229d8fd9e70bfac31f6">"Really? But there are times when you're alone in your room, right? At least I know that's not normal."

</p><p data-p-id="e3093aca35b9f1e233fa5b9a022a1cb0">Dimodia, Kara, and Soda have their eyes wide open every day.

</p><p data-p-id="033622e188d9ab89b32ff1e359adf82d">Kiri used to smile with a smile on her face.

</p><p data-p-id="cb2e2b840faee766d2894a9ca9b7fdf0">Eustaf murmured. <br>"So I put up with it."

</p><p data-p-id="d9968dd069a6025fe9e1c912e1f4621c">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="19a98e099a34ecfc3dfd8f4c1d61036a">"No."

</p><p data-p-id="450e82487d194c3388792f0e246d102d">Eustaf kissed her on the forehead and then asked.

</p><p data-p-id="80df3314385f5b08a526d8c1cb4b80aa">"But that's what you read earlier."

</p><p data-p-id="81f3fae0e3a98ff5027eeb135d7d3c1c">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="a1c788dfdc01b1509e558bde3f628b8e">"Can you give me more details?"

</p><p data-p-id="6d972b6124de6fc30a09b41a159ee4b9">"Oh, yes."

</p><p data-p-id="cc9b7960bd6aa8b92a96618da8c94dd8">Lan nodded and talked in as much detail as she remembered. Eustaf heard the story of Baron Lindbergh's regent, his daughter-that is, his cousin and his marriagewithout any change in expression.

</p><p data-p-id="7057ce2b8fa0f24e8d462d5c414c1714">It's just a story that's likely to be true for him.

</p><p data-p-id="28d697cd003670a7f3f4e62af0e5c5d5">And as time went by, Lan's story became vague, and I knew very little of the story afterward. But Lan told him what she knew.

</p><p data-p-id="ae25aa3ddd6c1dfe3bccac5fe83a7fe9">"You said Delphanto, didn't you? The darkness sealed against the wall."

</p><p data-p-id="631842d2c9f25b831cc89f40b76cd216">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="5e7cd09e0a82b1a3c88401828acb9bdb">"It's probably the Black Dragon."

</p><p data-p-id="584b5f241a695c3d7f66b377e3a8945f">Eustaf raised his eyebrows lightly. said Lan, frowning.

</p><p data-p-id="1c1ce7546e2597ac7de25249ebc3d7f0">"He's vague, but I'm pretty sure he was. Are they supposed to be lovers? I think so."

</p><p data-p-id="459bf4e5e4ca1ec020da334e724b3104">"Lovers?"

</p><p data-p-id="0112414ece944eb10811f3b63a84776b">"Yes, but Iveria saved the continent from Masu, didn't she? She was a very powerful woman herself, but she still sacrificed a lot."

</p><p data-p-id="2fccc3b75ee9407d96dcbe91ded0ea25">Lan leaned against Eustaf.

</p><p data-p-id="272137359b1f46e99ed6a89818b809ea">"That's why Delphanto came up with it. Without them, <br>Iveria wouldn't have a hard time."

</p><p data-p-id="5ffc4cea496d1dd9d3afcf8d61dc0a09">"Indeed" <br>Eustaf nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="a33cf179972d0f45ce897b0670d85690"><b>Humans, Dwarves, and Elves.</b>

</p><p data-p-id="ce1da42f01188dc8151d9f064a0ebfe2">Harmony between tribes was close to impossible, and in fact within the same race.

</p><p data-p-id="92c9e27dc9253926433156383335d4e9">Iveria was a hero to all of them, but I could guess it was more troublesome.

</p><p data-p-id="b4a8658c7851b80b935cada74e56a98d">And if those guys are sacrificing their lovers.

</p><p data-p-id="bc6d47737610d910083d0faefbd68191">"That's why Iveria sealed Delphanto. I don't know exactly why."

</p><p data-p-id="c2af493e03da7db03090a2e6b21ddc63">"That's why Delphanto is looking for Iveria."

</p><p data-p-id="95ac05aae81c70576b1a1383f6766247">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="eda55f39183f696275a2eff8809c0913">At Lan's words, Eustaf took a long breath and said, <br>"Then we have to fight against the Black Dragon."

</p>

<p data-p-id="960a8395cf10325eff2215b4c1a1040e">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="0e64839f9543b230a3589e2252d79516">"Dragons"

</p><p data-p-id="dade17a519d3e755545c3de66a6d5738">Mumbled and Eustaf said.

</p><p data-p-id="d478b00aa2366d2c102557ece16eb71e">"I don't know if it's still a dragon."

</p><p data-p-id="0ec1ce691daad075aff006d8f9bae3a7">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="8073e614c6f492b05d72b421a7421601">"Even a dragon has a lifespan. A thousand years in the dark."

</p><p data-p-id="13d0dd03b0871a957e7a15284f2d0c78">Eustaf looked over her head.

</p><p data-p-id="d05b8b3ba810c9b5c7db2a1b27043613">"Well, is that really the Black Dragon in Delphanto?"

</p><p data-p-id="4c93fc605587459635e6ae4c790d54e2">Eustaf said so and opened his eyes wide. Lan thought for a moment, Is that so.

</p><p data-p-id="ea8bf6d6dc9ef67e972e08dddfa6da4b">"I don't know."

</p><p data-p-id="727bdb427d8da6b873c5755cce4d28f8">She nodded her head. Lan smiled quietly.

</p><p data-p-id="6d9f4fefa21376a949c33efe5646321c">When Eustaf looked down at her, she stood up and said.

</p><p data-p-id="b08922c57e8aa51577cf2f230d947fe2">"I didn't expect this to happen with Eustaf, but I did."

</p><p data-p-id="89c57fbcf2fe4b2cfe7887aa2974eb7a">"So am I."

</p><p data-p-id="bbbdfcf143a0cf0c48723e3ad3abebb9">"I really don't know about people."

</p><p data-p-id="5af689bbbb5e1d88357bddb2d911bfcd">She turned completely and supported herself with her knees and stood up. Eustaf looked up at her.

</p><p data-p-id="5cf4dc4dfd2bace3c42dcf920c1d4787">She wrapped around Eustaf's face and slowly scattered his lips with her thumb.

</p><p data-p-id="113a6bbe0f60933be5e6095bf1a27e39">"Eustaf Laban de Lacia." She smiled.<br><br>"I love you."

</p><p data-p-id="d0efcb05f432d3cf69d085dcc902598f">His eyes widening. Lan whispered, "I don't think I said it yet," and kissed him lightly on the lips.

</p><p data-p-id="a2b96c10c6482f0074b8239cf850d322">Eustaf reached out and pulled her head and kissed her deeply again. His other hand climbed up her waist. Lan swallowed her breath as she felt his hot hand on the shirt.

</p><p data-p-id="2615e599eab686827541a59dc3f7403d">The hand that came down again, sweeping the soft side of her side, supported her and lay down on the chair. Lan embraced his shoulder and accepted a rough kiss.

</p><p data-p-id="a87eec48b2729de6d705faeaeba762bc">The stimulus was so strong that tears flowed out naturally.

</p><p data-p-id="28aac6cf1b7e5dba4873369e23c5baf4">He barely stopped kissing and said in a husky voice, with her tears lightly poking up.

</p><p data-p-id="a7d7c2b08e7f5989e8b0c7e89fe963f3">"Do you want to provoke me when you're alone?"

</p><p data-p-id="779932cc0e441cddc598e31accbda5a1">"It's not shameless than to sleep without marriage."

</p><p data-p-id="bccfb03b13a7ebe0325d33713ea0858e">At her words, he groaned and pressed her slightly, as if he had been caught up in her words.

</p><p data-p-id="ad90c5fd96439a8867188df8f5fa1858">Under his weight, Lan burst into laughter, shouting "Youth!"

</p><p data-p-id="90a68ea7c4b35503f24576ef9177a724">Eustaf bite lightly at her neck, and Lan struggled, shouting, "Eustaf!"

</p><p data-p-id="4d9fcdb8d1cbd9dc59340be47848ba21">Eustaf looked up and said. <br>"Then in spring, we get married, not engaged."

</p><p data-p-id="30a5dae89561f139f492be62c12b9d39">"What?" <br>Lan opened her eyes wide.

</p><p data-p-id="13ab88cedd6901a51a17d7ab2f8a82b4">"What about Lan? Don't you want to pull it?"

</p><p data-p-id="29b41f491e8fa9c89ef308f9e7e0d7ed">She stammered in surprise.

</p><p data-p-id="fd69581d31bd46e11680352a90e82779">"No, it's, no, I'm ·····."

</p><p data-p-id="df958c2fd200f6997fca10a85ea00ddb">It was good to hear that it was a marriage, but I felt like I wasn't ready at all.

</p><p data-p-id="10d9fe1b43d0815ebf749bbdf41e7354">Eustaf asked again about her reaction. "Or shall we just get engaged? Faster?" Lan nodded quickly.

</p><p data-p-id="c61ad8e9e9038ad1e5b622d15d72db28">"Yes, that's good."

</p><p data-p-id="447017dd7dbc7c99a8be91d267e2632a">There was a satisfied smile on Eustaf's face.

</p><p data-p-id="c691754c56dadc80b3153dbe75d1c03e">"All right."

</p><p data-p-id="e8594556a446d6d559aef392b727bc1b">He lifted himself up and easily grabbed Lan to his feet up.

</p><p data-p-id="aefbde0b24c188a49e5be520efb053bf">"I don't think I'm going to be able to keep my head above water."

</p><p data-p-id="aae92584fd117de5fa4a1a3540df725a">Lan laughed because it sounded like a joke, and Eustaf whispered in her ear.

</p><p data-p-id="26fb67af415fee614c936f9d65b6cd33">"Really, I'm not kidding at all."

</p><p data-p-id="17f18e88d40d69c198e4f47f41ca11ec">His voice was low and his desire was deep, so Lan quickly erased her smile.

</p><p data-p-id="a18673fecb3a4297d739c8de61523d5a">"Bip."

</p><p data-p-id="08e3d57e1ee66f94752e2eaa459e4256">Lan sat quietly with his hands together, and Eustaf leaned against the wall.

</p><p data-p-id="6a90280169424ae1d4a0a4ccc9e75f81">Lan looked at Eustaf like that. A clear blue that shows that black hair is glossy and neatly passed over, and that the eyes are blue even if they are far away.

</p><p data-p-id="3cbd0006ebc3e9988fd44d3a22d8ab09">His wide shoulders, tall height and perfect proportion.

</p><p data-p-id="d666bf6b1e2d047670304a62593b5279">'Not to mention his handsome face. He has a nice voice.'

</p><p data-p-id="469072e019093c8830feaebfc91416cd">If you sing "Ran" in a low voice, your body shakes by itself.

</p><p data-p-id="d0a0c07b29699f1b3ea383fa3a8bd4b5">He's good at playing the piano and swordsmanship. He is also a good lord.

</p><p data-p-id="e25bd161dcbc6651ce991e7907327fc7">Above all, with him, my heart was pounding and at the same time relieved.

</p><p data-p-id="0c776045cae25eaa861d92e05adc30fe">'I can't believe such a perfect man loves me.'

</p><p data-p-id="b033bebe8968d97be8d86cabc5211a0b">"Ran"

</p><p data-p-id="84afe328a06c88760ec5c220f59a0bb3">At Eustaf's call, Lan looked at him in surprise, saying, "Huh?" and he said languidly.

</p><p data-p-id="922c65ebd7f22e706d106e198a1abaf0">"I'll eat you."

</p><p data-p-id="327f9ed91600b3dd08b5410c041de63d">Lan's face turned red. She jumped up and said.

</p><p data-p-id="0f88199aea61a97a94d5a440aa1b3764">"I, I didn't think about that."

</p><p data-p-id="335e01a817d1630788adc77ffd8441f9">"Then what were you thinking?"

</p><p data-p-id="5c142343ce61e02bfc31115293899fba">"Just because Youth is..... handsome......"

</p><p data-p-id="663cdb4b15725eaf9a9d996877186f77">The sound was mumbling in her mouth, but he still understood it well.

</p><p data-p-id="a3839afbb790788b515bef69f4ba6474">"I'm glad it's your taste."

</p><p data-p-id="0226aebb2e127c723978153f1e7a04ff">Lan's face turned redder at his words.

</p><p data-p-id="99077dfdbeb6ab87a39c383ec1c7cbd9">She jumped up from her seat and approached the cupboard.

</p><p data-p-id="cf590639285c7133c1b9586b0da91398">"Is there anything to eat? Come to think of it, isn't it the biggest problem without our food isn't it?"

</p><p data-p-id="91711a6f5beba58c52dd63e3737713b1">You won't die if you starve for a few days.

</p><p data-p-id="09692e5ebf8e971baa26d77c62ca8f44">When she opened the cupboard, there was a square, hardlooking bread that looked tasteless.

</p><p data-p-id="03614b7cf9479ce26918d8a0b99c9b66">"What is this?"

</p><p data-p-id="b6e9df03f98f5482696bab1931d12559">"Healthy."

</p><p data-p-id="d4fc006bf3b5332a9f6be1c7f565bc01">When did you come, Eustaf took a hard bread like a brick out of the cupboard. Lan took it and put out her tongue.

</p><p data-p-id="31a98f2b4cfd5339746a80670c4b4eff">"If I hit someone with this, I'd hurt them. How can I eat this?"

</p><p data-p-id="b38a94fbe5f7299df4a87ac5559b2978">"Because I'm soaked in water. Or I'll chew it a little bit."

</p><p data-p-id="2da31a2c340d301b6e170c06bcfd514c">"......Delicious?"

</p><p data-p-id="6f26b12fb38230107d1a850bcc00726f">"No way."

</p><p data-p-id="1a669a964177797de1e4106d219c7e58">At Eustaf's words, Lan sighed and put the bread back in place.

</p><p data-p-id="eec3c7a1c2afc11d58fee6898373175a">"Use it when you really need it."

</p><p data-p-id="e829dae8ea32b01417d07fccb9bfba53">Eustaf smiled lightly. He found a bag of tea in the other corner, and the two made tea.

</p><p data-p-id="2c5f6bf0044150808eb84a7c379b6bc1">The story came out nonstop because we were together.

</p><p data-p-id="bd2690238554a966e2533d8575b8fa75">From territorial issues to trade, business, and future plans.

</p><p data-p-id="f292de1ded96001bd804c71ee6a0bdb6">I was talking for a while and Lan yawned long. The time is unknown, but the heavy eyelids seemed to be quite deep at night.

</p><p data-p-id="3d88ae6af9974a9b15b87c6e11cb830d">"Go to sleep." <br>Lan nodded at Eustaf's words.

</p><p data-p-id="ebf292553b0c365f6544db08d4814dd7">She crept into the blanket and said. <br>"Youth, come here. It's just one blanket."

</p><p data-p-id="7219e8850351941a9d806e07d350c433">"Are you trying to test my patience?"<br><br>"Yes, it's better to stay warm than in the cold."

</p><p data-p-id="6cf37e5188649b34dd4756a3d03ae58a">He sighed when she said, tapping on the seat next to her. Nevertheless, he did not want to refuse completely, so he went under the covers as Lan recommended.

</p><p data-p-id="48f8bf9f06d7710b29b058192a950612">When Eustaf put his hand around her waist, Lan laughed and said.

</p><p data-p-id="9ef284bfdbc715b99666f8561d05e109">"Good night."

</p><p data-p-id="0cf37525b158597b29882976058e2257">"Yes, go to sleep."

</p><p data-p-id="e8b1208832640600eddc94c9834170b4">He kissed her on the cheek, and Lan quickly fell asleep.

</p><p data-p-id="64c3fcf5be48dccfb936b01f016de3f6">Eustaf sighed, hugged her a little closer, fixed her posture, hug again, pulled himself away, and tossed and turned.
