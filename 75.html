<p>Ran nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I got it."</p>

<p>Countess Lieselotti was famous for being a social leader. At her party, most of the games were paired, so there were couples who were unintentionally.</p>

<p>Of course, it was popular with existing couples, so her ball was almost impossible to get an invitation during the social season.</p>

<p>"I'm coming with Katy, and Ran is with the Duke?"</p>

<p>Ran answered quietly, "Yes," and nodded.</p>

<p>Elise grinned excitedly.</p>

<p>"I'm looking forward to it."</p>

<p>"Me too."</p>

<p>I've never done this before.</p>

<p>And you've never seen Eustaf before.</p>

<p>It was so fun and exciting to have the two together for the first time. The first is anything special.</p>

<p>Elise looked up while she stares at her face.</p>

<p>"But why are you only dating? Wouldn't it be okay to get engaged? No matter how old it is, if it's just a simple relationship, there's going to be a lot of gossip."</p>

<p>At Elise's words, Ran said, "Yes." and smiled awkwardly. Elise shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Of course, I won't ask if you don't want to, but Ran likes him and he like you, and I don't know what's wrong with you."</p>

<p>Elise said, tilting her upper body closely.</p>

<p>"Is it because of the bad rumors? Like,</p>

<p>'I'm afraid my bad rumors might get to you.' Oh, my God. Is that what it is?"</p>

<p>Ran burst into laughter because Elise held both hands tightly and spoke in a theatrical tone when she played "black" in the middle.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, not like that."</p>

<p>"Then?"</p>

<p>"That-"</p>

<p>Ran had a suspicious expression.</p>

<p>"Do you think Eustaf will change his mind...?"</p>

<p>After talking, Ran was so dumb that she shut her mouth. It felt the same way for Elise, so she blinked her big eyes a few times and asked.</p>

<p>"Do you see any signs of that?"</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"No, when I hear that from Ran, he feel like he's a playboy who'll change his mind for a while and he'll change his mind soon. So where did Ran get that feeling?"</p>

<p>"No, Eustaf....is not a man who shows signs of….."</p>

<p>"So, that's weird. Of course, when you're happy, you say you're nervous. - Ran's a little different. Hmm...The kind of thing that you assume will happen already…?"</p>

<p>Elise's words penetrated the core and Ran blinked.</p>

<p>"Is that so….?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>Elise added seriously.</p>

<p>"And isn't that a big courtesy to the Duke?"</p>

<p>There was no rebuttal to the argument.</p>

<p>"That's true."</p>

<p>Ran nodded softly, and Elise smirked.</p>

<p>"Of course, Ran is closer to the Duke than I am, so there might be something else that you feel."</p>

<p>"No, it was a big help, you’re a big help." Ran nodded deeply.</p>

<p>"That's a relief."</p>

<p>Elise smiled. She said with her fingers crossed.</p>

<p>"I look forward to the ball of Countess Lieselotti. It was fun last year, too."</p>

<p>"You know how it was."</p>

<p>"Well. What are you doing this year?"</p>

<p>The two continued to laughed and talked with anticipation.</p>

<p>******</p>

<p>Olivia pushed aside the medicine Devan had brought.</p>

<p>"What are you bringing with you?"</p>

<p>Devan sat down and whispered softly at her words.</p>

<p>"I've heard rumors that I'm particularly good at this place, so I've built it. It's a medicine that makes the child listen well. They say there's no couple who haven't had a baby since they
<p>ate."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I'm fine."</p>

<p>Devan nodded at Olivia's words.</p>

<p>"You’re saying you're okay, I know. But..." Devan gathered the eyebrows gently.</p>

<p>"We can't keep the rumor from leaking. I heard what happened between His Majesty and the Duke of Lazia. Is that true?"</p>

<p>"Which one is true?"</p>

<p>Devan stared at his sister. In the end, it was Olivia who opened her mouth first.</p>

<p>"If the Duke is asking if he want an all-out war, is it true?"</p>

<p>Bam!</p>

<p>Devan hit the table with his palm and gritted his teeth.</p>

<p>"Can he do that? The Lazian bastards have no manners, nothing."</p>

<p>"But it's also true that Ruth did something wrong. The relationship between Lazia and the Imperial family is just like that, right?"</p>

<p>"However."</p>

<p>Devan's anger still lingered. He asked.</p>

<p>"Are you alright? Isn't he intimidating you too?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine."</p>

<p>Olivia smiled softly. Then she lowered her eyes and said,</p>

<p>"Brother, I actually have something to tell you."</p>

<p>"Yes, tell me."</p>

<p>"It seems that the Emperor still hasn't let go of the Lord of Lazia, the Earl of Romia."</p>

<p>Devan's purple eyes sparkled. He hadn't forgotten that the emperor had humiliated his sister for her.</p>

<p>Olivia's lips were shaking.</p>

<p>"And what's more, I don't have any children yet, do I? Do you happen to..."</p>

<p>Devan held Olivia's hand tightly.</p>

<p>"It never happens! If His Majesty is in his right mind, he knows how important orthodoxy is for his succession."</p>

<p>'He doesn’t have that kind of mind.'</p>

<p>Olivia thought so and looked even more pensive.</p>

<p>"So I dissuaded him, and he raised his hand to me."</p>

<p>"…what…..?"</p>

<p>Devan's voice sank low. She is a gold, a jade, a younger sister, but he raised Olivia with care like her own daughter.</p>

<p>"He put his hand on you?"</p>

<p>The voice snapped with anger. Olivia's tears overflowed without realizing it. Devan held her hand tightly. His voice seemed to whisper.</p>

<p>"Isn't his father giving him a child, too?"</p>

<p>Olivia blinked her eyes and nodded. Tears streamed down her cheeks again.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did."</p>

<p>Devan jumped up from his seat and said, wailing.</p>

<p>"The Earl of Romia is already under the protection of the Duke of Lazia. Your Majesty will never get his hands on her."</p>

<p>The word caught Olivia like a thorn in her throat. Without realizing it, she said.</p>

<p>"You don't know that, do you?"</p>

<p>Devan thought Olivia was worried and said affectionately.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Lazia did not offer Count Romia under the pressure of the Emperor. Plus, they're living together in the green arch. Then it's obvious. But…"</p>

<p>Other illegitimate children and women seemed to need to be sorted out. I had to warn the emperor not to behave himself.</p>

<p>Things went a little differently than I thought, so Olivia bit her lips. Devan grinned.</p>

<p>"You don't have to worry. Via. I'll take care of everything. You're still the empress of the Empire, and you're at the top of the ladder. I won't let you lose that position."</p>

<p>And he kicked out of the room. Olivia wiped away her tears. She was smirking.</p>

<p>'But you're not saying we should go home together right now.'</p>

<p>But it's the same for him. As long as the Duke of Miro blood flows, it's the same.</p>

<p>'I have no intention of losing this position, nor of becoming a pitiful flower.'</p>

<p>Olivia thought so and looked at the medicine Devan had left behind.</p>

<p>'Kid?'</p>

<p>I didn't mean to have Ruth's baby. In fact, that would be the safest way, but she hated it.</p>

<p>You have the child of the other person who crushed her pride. That's absurd.</p>

<p>'But it's time to have it.'</p>

<p>Olivia's fingers patted the table lightly.</p>

<p>'I'm sure he'll get rid of all the women he's involved with.'</p>

<p>You have touched the pride of the Duke of Miro. Olivia did a little bit of lips.</p>

<p>'Ruth will be furious about it again, but he won't be able to touch me because he's scared of my brother. Hhm… I can't believe you're Duke of Lazia.'</p>

<p>She picked up the medicine bottle.</p>

<p>******</p>

<p>"Huh? You can't come with me today?"</p>

<p>"Suddenly something came up. I'm so sorry."</p>

<p>At Eustaf's words, Ran looked at him for a moment and nodded.</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"I'll join you as soon as I'm done."</p>

<p>Ran's face brightened at Eustaf's words.</p>

<p>"Oh, are you coming?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm just afraid it's going to be delayed..."</p>

<p>"Alright."</p>

<p>Ran replied with a smile, so Eustaf wrapped her waist and kissed her lightly. He said after lingering from her lips.</p>

<p>"Why is it sweet?"</p>

<p>Panicked, Ran stammered,</p>

<p>"It's because I put honey on my lips a while ago. It- it moisturizes your lips·····."</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>Eustaf said so and kissed her again.</p>

<p>Ran swallowed her breath. Eustaf took off his lips and whispered.</p>

<p>"I think it really is."</p>

<p>"Eus!" with a mild pain in his lips, he retorted.</p>

<p>"Not bad. Sweet things, too." Ran's face turned red.</p>

<p>"Really, really-"</p>

<p>But I had nothing to say. Then, Dimodia entered the room and frowned.</p>

<p>"You don't just come in when she's groomed."</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>When asked by Eustaf, Ran said, pushing his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Later, later."</p>

<p>"I'll look forward to it. I'll see you at the ballroom."</p>

<p>Eustaf kissed her on the back of her hand and then backed away.</p>

<p>Dimodia grumbled.</p>

<p>"I don't know if you're singing it during the second makeup session, but no matter how much you're dating, you're not coming now."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess that's a little too much since we live in the same house..."</p>

<p>Ran muttered like that. Dimodia said with a grin.</p>

<p>"Well, there are good things about it. Well, let's finish dressing up."</p>

<p>Dimodia laughed, saying, "Isn't this your first social debut as Count Romia?" Ran also nodded with a firm resolution.</p>
