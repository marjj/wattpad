<p>At Ran's words, Kiri looked embarrassed and soon nodded.</p>

<p>"Nice."</p>

<p>"Kiri!"</p>

<p>Kiri laughed when Dimodia complained with a frown.</p>

<p>"But you'd better learn how to make fun of yourself, right? It's better to learn the surface than to know anything."</p>

<p>"But-"</p>

<p>Dimodia mumbled.</p>

<p>"May the Lord grant you permission."</p>

<p>Kiri blinked, turned her whole body toward Ran and asked politely.</p>

<p>"Dear Earl, do I need Lord permission?"</p>

<p>Ran smiled and said, "No," and Kiri smiled like a fox.</p>

<p>"Then I'll teach you."</p>

<p>Dimodia muttered, 'Oh, I don't know,' and Soda and Kara looked worried, too.</p>

<p>Ran held her hands tightly together with joy alone.</p>

<p>"Really? Then you can start right now."</p>

<p>"But we still need to be ready, so let's start with tomorrow."</p>

<p>Ran nodded at Kiri's words. I remembered the swordsmanship that Eustaf showed me before.</p>

<p>'Not to that extent, though.'</p>

<p>But I wanted to be able to keep my body. Kiri began training just as she said on yesterday. She admired Ran's armor. It was Nadium's clothes, which had been blocked before.
<p>It looks like just loose underwear when worn, but when you slightly turn the jewelry attached to your chest, it sticks tightly to your body and the texture changed as if it were steel.</p>

<p>"You'll wear this and train."</p>

<p>Kiri said so and began Ran's training. Training was completely different from Ran's idea.</p>

<p>'I thought you'd at least grab a wooden stick and shake it.'</p>

<p>Shouldn't we start with a fitness exercise that doesn't matter at all, let alone a wooden stick?</p>

<p>After training with interval players, sweat poured out even though it was winter.</p>

<p>Ran gasped. Steam rose over her shoulder.</p>

<p>said Kiri with a smile.</p>

<p>"You have more basic physical strength than I thought? I didn't know you could follow me from day one."
<p>"I feel like throwing up."</p>

<p>My mouth smelled sweet. When Ran gathered her breath and spoke at once, Kiri replied.</p>

<p>"It's okay because you didn't vomit."</p>

<p>She then covered Lan with a big towel and said,</p>

<p>"This is the end of today's training. Go inside and wash before you get cold."</p>

<p>"Yes..."</p>

<p>With a nod, Ran staggered inside. It was a little far from the mansion because the Knights rented one side of the training ground.</p>

<p>'Should I just wash up?'</p>

<p>I thought of a public shower room attached to the Knights' room. There were no women in the Knights of Blue flame, so a separate shower room was created for men and women.
<p>"Don't."</p>

<p>As if I had read such an idea at that time, Lumiere came out and whispered where he appeared. Ran jumped up.</p>

<p>"Lumiere!"</p>

<p>"Master, you thought you'd use the shower, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Ran replied awkwardly to what he said with a smile on his eyes.</p>

<p>"Uh, yes.."</p>

<p>"No, the other knights will faint, so please go back to the mansion."</p>

<p>"Should I·······?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kiri, who organized the tools, walked up and said,</p>

<p>"It's cold, so go home. You'll catch a cold. Don't talk on the street, either."</p>

<p>Lumiere coquettishly-Ran thought Lumiere would be the only man who matched the word so well.- Laughing at Kiri.</p>

<p>"My master seems to be considering using the Knights Shower Room."</p>

<p>"Are you out of your mind?"</p>

<p>Ran's face was frowned upon by Kiri's words.</p>

<p>"Is it that bad?"</p>

<p>"That's about it. All right, get in there. Dimodia will be waiting for you with the water."</p>

<p>Ran, who was pushed back to her room by two people, soaked herself in a hot tub and groaned.</p>

<p>'Yeah, I needed a bath, not a shower.'</p>

<p>Ran applauded inwardly for Kiri and Lumiere's wisdom.</p>

<p>'And Lumiere gotten a lot better.'</p>

<p>He felt like he kept changing to the good side. Blindness as it used to be disappeared little by little, and in addition, Blaine was so absorbed in training that he even seriously told Ran,</p>

<p>"I might lose my job as a leader."</p>

<p>'Yeah, Lumiere's cutting it.'</p>

<p>Feeling pleased, Ran smiled without realizing it. Ran breathed out, putting her hot cheeks on the round part of the marble bathtub that was still cold.</p>

<p>'You're coming next year.'</p>

<p><b><i>Sina.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>Ishina.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>The main female character.</i></b></p>

<p>Ran felt guilt and strange feelings toward her.</p>

<p>'Cause I'm dating Eus.'</p>

<p>The feeling of taking her place. Sina's coming at the New Year's EveThere's really not much time left.</p>

<p>But at the same time, there was something I was looking forward to. What kind of person is she, I want to meet her in person.</p>

<p>She's beautiful, she's brave, she's indomitable-</p>

<p>"Excuse me."</p>

<p>With a small voice, Soda opened the door and asked.</p>

<p>"Is the water temperature appropriate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, good."</p>

<p>"You have red cheeks."</p>

<p>"Is it a little hot·······?"</p>

<p>"Get out of the bath. Lie down and I'll massage you."</p>

<p>At the word, Ran sprang out of the bathtub. Lying on a smooth bed made by sanding down trees thousands of times, soda and Kara came in with a good scent of perfume.</p>

<p>Feeling the separation of bones, flesh, and muscles, she was massaged until she became mushy, then smelling the sweet aroma of flavor, and Ran dried her hair in front of the bedroom fireplace.</p>

<p>Glittering, milky hair waved over the fireplace.</p>

<p>There is a magic lamp and a heater, but I couldn't give up the romance of the fireplace.</p>

<p>At that time, the door opened with some noise. When Ran looked up after combing, Dimodia stood with a troubled face.</p>

<p>"The Lord is here-"</p>

<p>"Eus? Tell him to come in. What's going on?"</p>

<p>When Dimodia saw Ran with her lips tightly closed, Ran got up from her seat, saying, "Ah!" and received a thick gown from Soda.</p>

<p>"I'll go out."</p>

<p>Only then did Dimodia grinned.</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>Ran put a soft navy gown on top of her indoor clothes and tied her belt tightly before going out to the living room. Ran was surprised when her eyes met with Eustaf, who was standing in the
<p>middle of the living room.</p>

<p>It was because he was standing with his armor on and a helmet on his side.</p>

<p>"Eus? What's that? What's going on?"</p>

<p>"The messenger is here. There's a demon in a village near the ice wall. Winter is just beginning, so I thought it would be fine until winter hunting."</p>

<p>He frowned and said,</p>

<p>"So, I'm going to lead the Knights out."</p>

<p>"Oh! Okay."</p>

<p>Ran nodded and asked.</p>

<p>"Where’s the messenger?"</p>

<p>"He's a little boy, but he's injured pretty badly. Can Ran take care of him?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Ran said with emphasis. I thought he was a soldier because he was a messenger, but he was a village man. Eustaf nodded at Ran's words.</p>

<p>"It's a scramble, so I'll start right away. I'm here to say hello before I go."</p>

<p>At the words, Ran hesitated to approach and lightly fiddled with the shoulder decoration that fixed Eustaf's cape.</p>

<p>"Have a safe trip."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Then he lifted Ran's chin lightly and bent down to kiss her.</p>

<p>"It smells good."</p>

<p>His hand lightly swept Ran's arm down.</p>

<p>"I just washed it ····."</p>

<p>Ran said with a blush. The cold armor touch gave me light goosebumps.</p>

<p>"I'll be back."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>My voice came out small without realizing it. Eustaf smiled and greeted lightly before leaving the room. Dimodia said with a dark face.</p>

<p>"Strangely, the appearance of beast has increased these days."</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>Ran nodded. Because she also read the documents with Eustaf, it was possible to confirm by numbers that the number of small monster attacks has increased in recent years.</p>

<p>'I'm sure it's because of it.'</p>

<p>Ran bit her lips with anxiety.</p>

<p>Darkness beyond the ice wall.</p>

<p>'I'm always doing my seal ritual, so can you not come out like this?" That would be great.'</p>

<p>It was exciting to see a powerful enemy in the book, but the first thing I thought was that I wanted to run away because I thought I had actually done it in front of me.
</p>

<p>'The one who doesn't run away is amazing.'</p>

<p>Eustaf, Sina, Lumiere--</p>

<p>'I'm going to cheer up, too.'</p>

<p>Ran thought so and decided to search the library. We must find some clues somehow.</p>

<p>Ran told Dimodia that she would go see the child right away. The doctor's office was located on the first floor of the Sky Mansion.</p>

<p>When Ran entered the clinic, the therapist greeted her.</p>

<p>"I heard a child came to let me know that Masu showed up. If he's seriously injured?"</p>

<p>The therapist nodded with a dark face at Ran's words.</p>

<p>"He's not feeling very well. Would you like to see it for yourself?"</p>

<p>Ran nodded softly. The therapist led Ran to the inside bed. There was a boy lying down.</p>

<p>Now twelve? Was it about thirteen?</p>

<p>He was wearing a bandage, and his face was not good, and he looked busy breathing.</p>

<p>'So, this world is over if you can't breathe yourself.'</p>

<p>"Is there anything lacking?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Fortunately, he still has the world record, so that's about it. Without it, he would have died."</p>

<p>At the therapist's words, Ran said, "I see," and swept her chest.</p>

<p>The three-coefficient ointment obtained through a deal with Haresh was older, so it was less useful than the new one, but it still performed better than any human-made medicine.</p>

<p>'It makes the flesh look fresh.'</p>

<p>It was only a high price and had a small number of them, so I kept them for a household stock, but according to the situation, Eustaf told me to use them.</p>

<p>"If things change, or if there's anything you need, let me know."</p>

<p>Ran said so and approached the bed and held the child's hand.</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>When asked by Ran, the therapist answered, "It's Miller," and Ran smiled and said quietly.</p>

<p>"Miller, I don't know if you can hear me or not, but cheer up. You'll be fine soon. There's nothing to worry about."</p>

<p>Whispering, Ran fell out of bed and asked the therapist again before leaving the clinic.</p>

<p>Covering herself tightly with fur, Ran came out to the second-floor public garden. I could see the ice wall piled up in front of me.</p>

<p>A mountain far up is really like a wall-</p>

<p>Krrrrrrr-</p>

<p>I heard a mountain crying in the distance. I learned that it was the sound of snow. Ran trembled lightly.</p>

<p>'I don't know what it is, but I'll never lose.'</p>

<p>Ran thought so and went back to the mansion and was stuck in a library.</p>

<p>******</p>

<p>'It's too bad for a wizard at times like this.'</p>

<p>Ran thought so and handed over the parchment paper.</p>

<p>'Should we go see the Wizard's Association?'</p>

<p>They were not on bad terms with the wizard, and they would also be interested in the great wise Iveria and the ice wall.</p>

<p>The beginning of the wizard is the great sage.</p>

<p>It would be good for battle if the wizard could not come to the sky mansion because of the ice wall, but it is troublesome when wisdom is needed.</p>

<p>Ran sighed and closed the parchment.</p>

<p>It has already been three days since the group of Eustaf chased the horse.</p>

<p>Eustaf contacted Ran every evening, saying that Masu, who attacked the village, had already left the village and was chasing them.</p>

<p>And he was still tracking their tracks. Masu seemed to be struggling because the speed of movement was much faster than humans, or even animals.</p>

<p>'Wish I could make a spell tracker or something.'</p>

<p>When I told Frances about it, he said, 'Is that possible?' and said it perfectly.</p>

<p>It's like looking at a designer·····</p>

<p>'I thought magic would be possible, but it's not.'</p>

<p>However, it also creates things that are impossible with modern science.</p>

<p>'For now, the source of the ice crystal itself is a fraud.'</p>

<p>Ran got up from her seat with a bunch of parchment paper, put it in an empty bookshelf one by one, and then picked up the parchment paper she had taken out again.</p>

<p>In this way, about half of the bookshelves were already filled.</p>

<p>'I'm working on a list one by one-'</p>

<p>I hope something useful comes out this time, and Ran pick over a thick leather binding.</p>

<p>'Huh?'</p>

<p>Ran opened her eyes wide.</p>

<p>'It's about a Sky castle . Oh, my God. It's Lazia's ancestors, right?'</p>

<p>The first was the autobiographical story of Lazia.</p>

<p>'You didn't make the Sky House by yourself, Iveria didn't you?'</p>

<p>It seemed to have been discussed with Lazia's Patriarch and extended one part or another later.</p>

<p>'Even if it's an extension ·····.'</p>

<p>When she swung her cane, a white building soared out of the ground. It was a sight that I could not believe even when I saw it with my eyes, so I tried calming myself.</p>

<p>Such a record led to a tongue-in-cheek argument. The blueprint of the Sky mansion, why the room was built, and several secret passageways were also written.</p>

<p>And his conversation with Iveria, the great wise one, and his personal opinion were written together, so she began to concentrate on reading books.</p>

<p>'I don't know anything about her, but...'</p>

<p>There's a book that's set up and there's something else that's been scribbling about. However, this record was new.</p>

<p>'As you already know, 'Blue ring' and 'Viridescent Crown' were both made by Iveria ·····.'</p>

<p>Just as the spirit is embedded in Blue ring, Iveria said that the Viridescent Crown also has a special ability.</p>

<p>Ran opened her eyes wide. It was the first thing she heard of.</p>
