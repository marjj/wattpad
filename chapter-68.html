<p data-p-id="9fe06be66840a8781cc3c4701f872027">Lazia had a long winter, so food shortages were chronic. Last year, I bought a large amount of food with money and distributed it, and as soon as spring came, I started lending food.<br><br>'I know that you shouldn't give it to me for free ·····.'<br><br>Instead, interest rates are set at·····
<br>
Eustaf had removed loan sharks like an ant with his fingers, and Ran thought, 'That, that much?' but he seemed to have been a bad guy and a hook that was not comparable to a modern private loaner.
<br>
Even Elizabeth was saying that she was relieved.<br><br>'If you think about it, isn't that the same thing for Lumiere?'
<br>
In a world where there's a possibility of being sold as a slave, a loan shark is a huge thing.
<br>Anyway, it wasn't too fancy, but I dressed up in fancy clothes and went on a tour.<br><br>On each way out, the territorial people came out and shouted "Long live Lazia!" and Ran banned it from being unbearable.<br><br>"How are you? Did you deserve this winter?"
<br><br>When asked by Ran, the farmer answered with a restless look.
<br>"Yes, of course! Thanks to you, I spent the winter without freezing anyone to death."<br><br>"Didn't you run out of ice or something?"<br><br>"That was enough."<br><br>"Good thing."
<br>Ran smiled with a smile.

<br>"Tell me if you need anything else. I'll petition the Duke." Then suddenly the farmer burst into tears.<br><br>"No, even this is enough. If I want more, I'm greedy."<br><br>Then he cried and Ran was really embarrassed, and the manager in the middle soothed him and said.<br><br>"I'm thrilled that such a high man has heard the story." No, it's like a great companion·······?<br><br>Ran thought so, and said, "Are you saying something unreasonable?

</p><p data-p-id="3f050b29aaa7c6dba46502b3b8286969">"We're not being forced to do this?" he asked, and the farmer fell flat on his face.<br><br>"No!! Really, it's been so long since I've had such an abundant winter - and you've been so kind to a man like me·····!"<br><br>Ran was embarrassed, but she tried to remain calm and said, as she was impressed.<br><br>"I'm glad I did. If there's anything uncomfortable in the future, please feel free to tell me."<br><br>Then she quickly left with her party.
<br>Riding on the horse, she left there and whispered to Lumiere, who ran side by side.<br><br>"I'm so surprised."<br><br>"Is that so?"<br><br>Lumiere blinked his eyes. He understood the farmer's mind too well.<br><br>"Maybe someone threatened me or asked me to compliment you?"<br><br>She frowned and asked seriously, so he smiled quietly.<br><br>"I don't think so. Whenever I think of my master, I cry." Lan opened her eyes wide and burst into laughter.<br><br>"Okay, okay, okay."
<br>Ran said so and looked around.

<br>'I'm gonna have to do a dark trip later.'
<br>I don't think the king sent a secret agent or a secret agent for no reason.
<br>Ran shook her head excitedly thinking so. If I could, I'd like to go on a tour from the end of the estate to the end, but it seemed difficult.
<br>I'd like to take a look around the home of the deities myself but-
<br>'I can't do that.'
<br>Everyone seemed to be quite happy that the duke, Eustaf, toured in person. But Ran, the count, had no authority. Even if you're a general or a patriarch, that's crossing the line.<br><br>'A duchess wouldn't know.'
<br>When I thought about it, Ran felt her cheeks turning red. She ran faster, consciously trying to shake the idea off.<br><br>"Then the patrol is almost over."
<br>Blaine, who followed her from behind, nodded at her words.<br><br>"That's right. I'll stay outside until today, and I'll go back to the Sky castle tomorrow."<br><br>"Oh, we're finally leaving."<br><br>I smiled thinking that the sky castle has become a complete sense of "my house."<br><br>"Before that, I'll stay at the villa today." Blaine added, saying so.<br><br>"And you didn't have to come out like this."
<br>Ran opened her eyes wide and smiled slightly at the words, and Blaine hurriedly added.<br><br>"Of course, I'm not saying anything, but it's hard to go on an outside tour."<br><br>"I know, but Eus- No, Lord want to keep it at its best because it's left to you."<br><br>She grinned as she said so. Blaine looked at her for a moment. There was a story that Eustaf gathered and told separately.<br><br>"I proposed to Ran."
<br>Everyone blinked because it sounded as if they were eating bread today.<br><br>Then it was his father, Baron Wilde, who rose from his seat like a tingling.<br><br>"You'll marry the Count Romia?!"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Then the Count of Illuminati asked slowly.
<br>"So did you succeed?"<br><br>"No."
<br>Rarely, Eustaf spoke with a bitter smile and asked sharply.<br><br>"I think you already knew."<br><br>"I heard from Ms. Lan."<br><br>"Is that so?"
<br>Eustaf's blue eyes glanced at him, and the Count of
<br>Illuminati replied briefly, "I didn't object."<br><br>The atmosphere between the people who went after Eustaf said so was different, but everyone felt "It's okay?" in common.<br><br>Elisabeth later said, "Are you marrying for profit, even though you don't like Ran?" but Blaine didn't think so.<br><br>'Anyway, she said no.'
<br>Blaine thought so, and when he looked at Ran, Ran asked.<br><br>"Is there something on my face?"<br><br>"No, it's nothing."
<br>In a hurry, Blaine turned his head.

</p><p data-p-id="a3d1420bc0ae892bd258bf58968d6f47">Ran blinked and said, wondering.
<br>"You're in a villa today?"<br><br>"Yes, the Lazian houses and villas that we built before exist here and there. There's a lot of bad management - it's a good place today."<br><br>"I see."
<br>Ran nodded.<br><br>This tour was also a week ago. Running on a muddy road was harder than running a horse, so Ran was riding, so the moment she got off the horse and threw herself into bed in the evening was always happy.<br><br>"I hope we get there soon." Ran said so and grinned.
