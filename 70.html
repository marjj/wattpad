                <p>Ran nodded.</p>

                <p>"Isn't that the history of most Lazia's side?"</p>

                <p>"I'm sure that's true, but you have a long life, aren't you?" Dwarf has a lifespan of 300 years.</p>

                <p>Wouldn't the record be much clearer because time is different from humans? Jetura said, pulling his beard out with his thick hands.</p>

                <p>"Well, I'll ask look around for you. Maybe I'll stay in the library."</p>

                <p>"I'd appreciate it."</p>

                <p>Ran thanked politely. Speaking of which, I'll ask Haresh later. I'm still looking at Lazia's library, but these days I've been busy with work and haven't been able to go in.</p>

                <p>'Come to think of it, your job is not normal.' Ran sighed while she was in public.</p>

                <p>'Don't stomp your feet and start with everything in front of you.'</p>

                <p>She thought so and thanked Jetura for the gift again. Then she said at the thought that suddenly crossed her mind.</p>

                <p>"Oh, can I ask you one more favor?"</p>

                <p>"Of course."</p>

                <p>Ran spoke softly at Jetura's words.</p>

                <p>"Lumiere, have you ever seen my escorts? Could you make a sword for him?"</p>

                <p>Jetura tapped his chest, saying, "Finally, you're asking me to do me a favor!"</p>

                <p>"Okay, leave it up!"</p>

                <p>"Really? Thanks."</p>

                <p>When Ran laughed, Jetura said with a shrugged.</p>

                <p>"I'll make you a really good sword. Can I talk to the escort for now?"</p>

                <p>"Of course"</p>

                <p>Ran nodded.</p>

                <p>Jetura said he would visit him right away, and he shook off Ranâ€™s hand and headed outside.</p>

                <p>"No, you don't even know where Lumiere is..."</p>

                <p>Ran muttered like that and called a servant to chase Jetura and ask him to guide the Knights to Lumiere.</p>

                <p>'Dwarf or Elf.'</p>

                <p>She thought so and left the box with her servant to send it up. Then she contacted Levery.</p>

                <p>The sale of the ice crystal was entirely due to the consignment on the top of the Golden Rose. I couldn't reach Levery right away because she was out of the phone, but Ran left a message.</p>

                <p>When she left a message asking the royal family to stop</p>

                <p>delivering, the employee seemed embarrassed, but only politely replied, "I will note it."</p>

                <p>Ran sat down, slowly holding a pen, and trying to write back to Eustaf, but suddenly she fell asleep.</p>

                <p>'Your reply was late, so I burned my heart. Why do I have to reply right away?'</p>

                <p>She thought so, hummed, and then put the pen back in. I wasn't going to send a reply for a while.</p>

                <p>Instead, Ran called Elizabeth and Blaine to tell Eustaf what he replied and what it was about. A sense of relief flashed through their faces.</p>

                <p>'Both of you were worried.'</p>

                <p>If you can't contact me like that, you deserve to be worried. And when Ran stopped delivering ice crystal to the imperial family, the two opened their mouths. Elizabeth burst into laughter and replaid,</p>

                <p>"That's a good idea." Blaine asked with a suspicious face.</p>

                <p>"Will that work for you? No matter how much I got used to the magical work. It hasn't been long since we started, has it?"</p>

                <p>Do you think that's gonna hurt him?</p>

                <p>Elizabeth said with a smile because of that question.</p>

                <p>"The key to this is that everyone else is enjoying their magic work."</p>

                <p>"Right. Think of themselves as turning on candles and fanning themselves when they turn on the coolers and keep the magic lamp in the summer."</p>

                <p>That's also a palace.</p>

                <p>You can't spread your horse's wings when you're riding in a carriage.</p>

                <p>Blaine's face brightened.</p>

                <p>"Surely so."</p>

                <p>"Right?"</p>

                <p>Ran grinned.</p>

                <p>"And there's one more thing to talk about." Ran then smiled meaningfully.</p>

                <p>******</p>

                <p>Eustaf was stuck in a green arch. Even if the emperor has a hair of hatred, Lazia is Lazia. Invitations for the social season came from all over the place, but the green arch remained silent without answering.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, the day became warmer and hotter because it was not sunny. Rolf, the butler of the green arch, rarely made a quick step.</p>

                <p>"Lord, we have a visitor."</p>

                <p>"Visitor?"</p>

                <p>Eustaf looked up with a curious face. Rolf quickly added that he was a rude guest to come in right away without an invitation.</p>

                <p>"The Marquis of Cyrus."</p>

                <p>Eustaf got up from his seat.</p>

                <p>"Bring him to the third room."</p>

                <p>"Yes."</p>

                <p>When Rolf heard the instructions and went back quickly, Eustaf touched his clothes.</p>

                <p>'What's going on? Visiting without a call?'</p>

                <p>However, I thought it could be because of the characteristics of Marquis Cyrus. Entering the third drawing room, the couple sat side by side.</p>

                <p>"Marchioness Cyrus."</p>

                <p>"Duke Lazia."</p>

                <p>When Cyrus stood up with a smile and was quite polite, Eustaf shook his hand.</p>

                <p>"You can just call me Eustaf."</p>

                <p>It was a natural lower bound.</p>

                <p>"Then Eustaf."</p>

                <p>Cyrus said so, and Elise bowed lightly, bending and straightening her knees.</p>

                <p>She asked.</p>

                <p>"Didn't Ran come with you?"</p>

                <p>"Yes"</p>

                <p>Eustaf answered Elise politely. Elise smeared her mouth.</p>

                <p>"It's sad. Is it true that you kicked Ran out of Lazia?"</p>

                <p>Elise's amber eyes narrowed, and Eustaf replied, "Yes."</p>

                <p>Elise was furious at the words and said, "How could you do that?"</p>

                <p>"I've given Ran a good chance. And now she is a Count."</p>

                <p>"Count?"</p>

                <p>Elise's face was a little deflated.</p>

                <p>Eustaf explained that he had given her a title, and Elise frowned and said, "Then shouldn't she be in the capital even more now? To be granted a title. No matter how many thousand-year-old Lazia is--"</p>

                <p>"Yes, I'm going to call on her when things get better here."</p>

                <p>"I see."</p>

                <p>Elise smiled at last.</p>

                <p>"I don't know what you're up to, but why don't you come with us?"</p>

                <p>Eustaf became curious.</p>

                <p>"With you."</p>

                <p>"Let's ride a horse and take a walk outside. It's the perfect weather to do that these days."</p>

                <p>Eustaf thought for a moment and nodded. It was definitely boring to stay inside the mansion, and there was no loss to know that it was close to the Marquis of Cyrus.</p>
