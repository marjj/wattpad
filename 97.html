<p data-p-id="fcf442f7f9e7991387196ce31790d695">Jetura pulled his beard with a satisfied face when he saw Lan open her mouth.

</p><p data-p-id="e11f08e4d3c411e2da8295542c4ac7c8">"How? Isn't it amazing?"

</p><p data-p-id="cdeb2ba6d4d8ac8e23dd0514c9dc643c">"Amazing. Oh, my God."

</p><p data-p-id="02bb4a8cd6b4760c6087de8b623524e9">Lan was constantly amazed.

</p><p data-p-id="5b102b5f8ef4dd6fe8da970b5c2c86d7">"I don't work in mines in winter. Human beings are weak and falling into....Anyway, I made it because my hands were empty and bored."

</p><p data-p-id="f6b1e06ea243bb4c17a63f98bdf810fa">Then Jetura beat the margarine. Other Dwarfs were happy faces.

</p><p data-p-id="b28e8de1dd491d63efcfe9ad594f41de">The harness made by stepping on the bellows throughout the winter was all the more luminous when it was put on the horse.

</p><p data-p-id="2533fb3ddd18f918c3061659c273f590">The atmosphere of the horse armed with a black harness was terrifying.

</p><p data-p-id="1ef2c0890c95386b6f41f0bc3ae29c32">'The blue knights' armor is black, right?'

</p><p data-p-id="1c7a57a144f98c3634c87119a73a618b">It is truly a black-and-white army. The weight of the harness was even light.

</p><p data-p-id="17bb7f56535cb44407081ea9de291758">In other words, the horse's momentum was almost the same as wearing light armor.

</p><p data-p-id="7985a43320eb80dad52227f9d64b7011">"How many of these did you make?"

</p><p data-p-id="b1c298f7af3e59639b51c321d1c516f8">When asked by Lan, Zetura said, "About 30?" Lan nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="899151be25e648a83b496f88bc4f8302">Zetura peeked at Lan's expression and said.

</p><p data-p-id="6697d9708d458d977050ba8112e5687e">"I can make it for all the knights if you want."

</p><p data-p-id="62a4943ca91e56252465ce3a24248f8d">"Surely, Please! Please."

</p><p data-p-id="1d19168b81b23ada8a7ad911ff3ab364">Zetura laughed out loud again at Lan's words. Yeah, I think I'm paying you back a little.

</p><p data-p-id="384321a9791933e252097472bac67a60">"It's a good mix of Nadium and Misril and steel. Look, the biggest place, it's easy enough to hold it with one hand, and the steel spearknife doesn't get stuck."

</p><p data-p-id="0216d6cca8e744b14d4502b8ee3a3d43">Lan listened intently to Jetura's explanation. The members of the Blue Knights also focused on Jetura's story to the point where their bodies tilted to that side.

</p><p data-p-id="8c083bcd6ea8cb53054a5386e85c32bf">Blaine was itching to go to battle right away.

</p><p data-p-id="87337398f0f9ef81fe9ed1b58273eef3">I wanted to know the performance of the new harness. Zetura said, showing a space for ice crystals.

</p><p data-p-id="41741b7c359d120061ff5e0f222f8c48">"And then you put the ice crystal in here, and you kick this part, and the magic comes into play. I'll speed up the horse's stammys. This part was helped by Frances. It was useful for human beings."

</p><p data-p-id="c43a267331014843a339850f8ea7630a">"Somehow I thought Frances was being overworked..."

</p><p data-p-id="71ae902971e2e11f939d6bd626a4a6bc">Lan thought she should double his salary to Frances.

</p><p data-p-id="704695bb78ff50826011af404fdfe966">Hahaha, Jetura laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="7e19323693e689148a7a8daffdd33eef">"Well, it's spring, and the mines are moving again, and they're just watching us do what we've told them to do. Time to finish making the marab."

</p><p data-p-id="2f00f4f3c044b7aeb2f4373fd68f15ff">"Thank you."

</p><p data-p-id="723dceeb1b66ec0a75fbcd7a4fe462dc">"Don't mention it. I'm sorry we don't have any data. All documents on the great wise man Iveria are prohibited from being taken out."

</p><p data-p-id="3d215499d8bd6a9b256a745149b6e381">"It's all right."

</p><p data-p-id="b1e0ca28881aa129be9e4c83702ce962">Lan shook her head.

</p><p data-p-id="3ca8906918cd7648e816bba8f0469a97">He said that there was only a small portion of the data that Haresch gave him in the past. Most of the data is prohibited.

</p><p data-p-id="115a7d49908c3f344fe6b61d4504d789">'Well, she said she was doing fine, though.'

</p><p data-p-id="925e7e7be2d827ff3bce67050bb7fadf">Lily and Lumiere were constantly giving and receiving letters. With the hopeful prediction that she will be healthy every day and be able to come back this year.

</p><p data-p-id="812f4e40527f8e75fa28e71da5321dcf">'Is it spring?'

</p><p data-p-id="5996d7ddbe5ef92afc519e8b0b8146a5">Lan looked up at the ice wall. A soft spring breeze blew. It was no longer a sharp wind as if my ears were falling off. 'It's the capital again.'

</p><p data-p-id="89db6e60a29a89aa8bfcd76d2de6daf2">Lan swallowed a sigh.

</p><p data-p-id="2584ec78671bd435bfd3ff32c4e285f6">Olivia and Label will be waiting when we get to the capital.

</p><p data-p-id="4e237c583a12e22d9b5b88467c276759">'Oh, I'm looking forward to seeing Lizzie.'

</p>

<p data-p-id="41052c3d40569e1d5a467008fcab7bb2">Lan grinned as she thought so. But when I thought of Olivia, I felt frustrated again.

</p><p data-p-id="709d0842ea7c637ab1a02fab4f2e083f">'I should've just met her then.'

</p><p data-p-id="aa96e789bb1ae2d661798c9a5ebe259a">Olivia asked to see her, but it was heartbreaking to come down to Lazia right away without meeting her.

</p><p data-p-id="2e3301fa3b2f2796168c963f20303af4">Wouldn't it have been different if we met then?

</p><p data-p-id="f71f26dff1bdfa557581bb1ac9342971">Did I avoid her too much?

</p><p data-p-id="f9d57a4e8c0b7fadc30eb904d5f1513c">'No, it was really scary.'

</p><p data-p-id="4675d2f49328103a1379c8b3a6b0f6e9">I didn't want to get involved in any way. But after this happened.

</p><p data-p-id="a41ba0dd89086f13a27d7d0a5a7998af">Lan was curious about one thing.

</p><p data-p-id="138b1ebcc214899b417204c04d90794a">'Did Olivia clean up Ruth? Or.....'

</p><p data-p-id="b033bebe8968d97be8d86cabc5211a0b">"Ran"

</p><p data-p-id="c6537f68ec43ea402c1bd7946c1d67c8">"Hhheuit!"

</p><p data-p-id="1337fdf88f2a56af240708329e33ea2a">Lan jumped from her seat, and Eustaf took a step back and said.

</p><p data-p-id="17af3f9e426a640e3577415cb784503f">"I didn't expect you to be so surprised."

</p><p data-p-id="347c795703771a41a4bb7f58ce185125">"N, no, I'm sorry."

</p><p data-p-id="cc0fb6527b56ca9f94c8b36b568f43f7">'Or--'

</p><p data-p-id="5b45c8930d0f65da08a7b248806a74ec">Lan stared at him, and asked Eustaf, touching his chin.

</p><p data-p-id="31b3623d5c93bc09e9fb5618fb8c88fe">"Did you get something?"

</p><p data-p-id="83937ed616bb7b0e6399b2c0c3e32d00">"No, I'm not."

</p><p data-p-id="db4cab6fc9899ec9f7e7eae1bad61861">When she answered, Eustaf looked suspicious and kissed her on the cheek.

</p><p data-p-id="d7312c2155c5a584814cb3a487cd2d29">"You're beautiful again today."

</p><p data-p-id="8574459511b22f63cd401e135eb99d2a">"It's the same as usual."

</p><p data-p-id="b07d39a65b70bfea971543610c34c64c">"I know."

</p><p data-p-id="1329dd7687a70b7fdc61ef9e018b3fa7">Smiling, Eustaf looked up at the armed horse.

</p><p data-p-id="48dcbb769f8797247fe3f02e26fb5248">"Good thing there's a lot of flat land in Lazia."

</p><p data-p-id="faaed0be33bbd49e7bcc4226af147067">"Most of them are pebbles."

</p><p data-p-id="ce65b47ebf6860cb5b3582b1b85bf498">Eustaf nodded at Lan's murmur.

</p><p data-p-id="2648656decaab0c9a8b60b388edb2bff">Most of the places were unable to farm wheat.

</p><p data-p-id="5e2872e4006d60dc8b5feb1fcf750122">When Eustaf continued to show courtesy to Jetura, Jetura jumped and shook his hand.

</p><p data-p-id="5baaa224f6ab88d2f1b7681ce41d4424">"Because I didn't mean to like you."<br><br>You can't even say hello. Eustaf whispered to her, <br>"Then I have to say hello to Noonim."

</p><p data-p-id="a9a444edd2f81cfa1498e5f895d84e9c">"Tell me what you want." Lan laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="1bbc000f6fde9539d2317bd781b1bc52">"Not at all."

</p><p data-p-id="5757e2af00264fb16fabda4e15cf489c">"I knew you would."

</p><p data-p-id="f24590cc2cd902effb65a5103b40af1b">Eustaf said so and asked Jetura.

</p><p data-p-id="525b41bf0143eae4103a85c73bd1c8eb">"Can I try all of them on now?"

</p><p data-p-id="25d6a0c8b3abc799ba97d32db9f7b11f">"Of course."

</p><p data-p-id="f6dcf808f87e78eaae5b21e317a06da0">Eustaf nodded and said to Blaine.

</p><p data-p-id="e3b1e9dd081e3448384f44c1ad87add3">"Let's put it on and go around."

</p><p data-p-id="da9e82e81df65d85dc4136b23bcdd45d">"Understand."

</p><p data-p-id="f2c0787c5f3fc5808a38329e100144e1">Blaine disappeared with an excited face, and Eustaf said.

</p><p data-p-id="dbe906eab1704db206be80a4b030bdef">"I'll have to come with him."

</p><p data-p-id="6452f60d2c8c2d1f956a9ab3ed1f6183">"Yes, be careful."

</p><p data-p-id="0e39f0bf5ab26f682b0276cae5f75ecd">At Lan's words, Eustaf nodded lightly and went to pick up his horse. Before Zetura left, he gestured to Lan, "Cham."

</p><p data-p-id="3a4b6bc0d7e70b4e0020723984d82b99">"You asked the driver to make a sword before, didn't you?"

</p><p data-p-id="e7b7ee7d1d0b46616992658adc9fe830">"Oh, yes!"

</p><p data-p-id="901485a8cb786ee199b9dce002a0d76c">I asked Jetura for Lumiere's sword.

</p><p data-p-id="a7af3d7ee2ea109c688f5470db73bb96">"It's done. I was going to give it to you myself, but you're the one who ordered it anyway."

</p><p data-p-id="5a2177f0b0c4fc0f6f3ca77b0cbf020f">Wait a minute, but soon he came back with a sword called Jetura.

</p><p data-p-id="9b16fd24c74dce886bebe90ba4a0f946">"Thank you."

</p><p data-p-id="edc3fe727ea1b16596903cacf4f9ba7c">Lan accepted the sword and smiled brightly. Zetura grinned and said.

</p><p data-p-id="0b31b87a42ac73036f71806a372b7893">"Wait, I'll call him."

</p>

<p data-p-id="4ab998b30ccb1c13c6a053be209959e4">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="c8d2c3cb05452b771f51661a68cd82c9">Lan nodded, and Jetura often walked away. Not long after that, Lumiere, wearing armor, appeared in armor. He looked surprised at Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="6a3737b0d306ec7b9f91748c18dc5a8c">"Is that what you called?"

</p><p data-p-id="1a0ceb7935bc827c6efec6a972f10404">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="fe1673e642041bc3c16d7db3d09d541b">"I see."

</p><p data-p-id="82ea22640616a72a8c066cd7e1b56632">"What? Why? Are you disappointed?"

</p><p data-p-id="9d957786be3740eb460b20d3d78e057f">Rumier grinned at Lan's words and asked,

</p><p data-p-id="6f26b12fb38230107d1a850bcc00726f">"No way."

</p><p data-p-id="22f231d8c8044718681c0038f1249f01">"What's going on? Now I'm in the middle of a--"

</p><p data-p-id="d1b395440b45ad0759cc74beb388f090">"Oh, you have to go right away. This!"

</p><p data-p-id="c054bc6d51ac2b03f084c249f598f64a">Ran out the sword as if it were pushing it into his arms, and Lumiere accepted it in a flash.

</p><p data-p-id="410cc47a1e6bfe4f9c22fd75413c92db">"Jetura made it for me. Dwarf is my sword, so I'm sure you'll like it."

</p><p data-p-id="15afb79a56fd22756f29cd9e5ac8d773">Lumiere looked at the search quietly and pulled out the blade. The blue blade clearly revealed its existence.

</p><p data-p-id="d174d2a824f3140d46bbdec3c530fc26">"That's a beautiful sword."

</p><p data-p-id="5ca6c4977b73974c8b270cb501e87a77">"Do you like it?"

</p><p data-p-id="b9d4c0c7447cee6d7849f0464437a5e7">"Of course."

</p><p data-p-id="b16982fbb0e5fa28cec5b515fd7c3d2a">"That's a relief."

</p><p data-p-id="bc0034719c0d56ef7d95fa2ec6a69d52">Lan swept her chest and pushed him away.

</p><p data-p-id="b495a8e73326519dc05ced2d62816f74">"Hurry up. You said you were going to test Magap." Lumiere was pushed and laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="7a2abce34d1fdf2b39bb34b49c2cb391">"All right"

</p><p data-p-id="33b97b20a5857bb5421e74222f7a63cf">Lan saw him off and went into the mansion.

</p><p data-p-id="033f2b8ee4f098517fa9c95f54589396">"Earl."

</p><p data-p-id="ccc4a4f21304c444cf5c4d9ce3a655f1">The butler called her in and offered her a silver platter politely.

</p><p data-p-id="8055a9c1d6f81715e3d556e9f57b9115">"There's a letter from the Wizards."

</p><p data-p-id="dd1f866c093fa7a8e02622fc338f53b8">"Finally!"

</p><p data-p-id="0656ac87d4d89d768368f86797b6a5e0">Lan picked up the letter quickly.

</p><p data-p-id="9fe3bfc96f676ae95e4f7d9b7fce9adf">"What about Sina?"

</p><p data-p-id="d0a7bf58042357228b7a6df3b96c9412">When asked by her, the butler said , "she's in her room," Lan headed to Sina's room.

</p><p data-p-id="f8d5af01a15f29cca31f17f2185539df">"Sina! The Wizard's Association replied."

</p><p data-p-id="06d4c8a4f66d70710a32128b94522b7a">As Lan entered the room, Sina, who was wielding a sword without a blade for practice, threw the sword on the sofa and ran.

</p><p data-p-id="9d13893faade836177a785bc923f4731">"Really? What did they say?"

</p><p data-p-id="6bcc4fb6ad6a232aaba7586ff61d4f7b">"I haven't opened it yet either."

</p><p data-p-id="ce6c8c67e67883d5fd18a9e6e61d66dd">Lan said so and held out the letter. Sina picked up the letter and held it out to Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="281db02ad791a16ae9a205df0004a819">"I can't read. Please tell me when you see it."

</p><p data-p-id="3f4a09c5c0f32620c1caa4d1ae52b1b1">Lan opened the letter by receiving a letter knife from the maid. And I quickly scattered the contents.

</p><p data-p-id="4c96af02d603ce87650c37add626761b">"..."

</p><p data-p-id="be80c6ab809327ae1872576cd21e7f35">"Unnie ······?"

</p><p data-p-id="b981dd16d78c710be6fceeac213b9acd">When Lan folded the letter and called it "Sina," Sina's face was distorted. Her lips trembled.

</p><p data-p-id="2de3678002ff15df6ba0b2862b31369d">"Oh, No, It Can't?"

</p><p data-p-id="03fa3b8b4f4630561fd50caa558c4ef3">Lan nodded softly and Sina snatched the letter from Lan's hand. <br>After reading the letter, Sina clenched her teeth.

</p><p data-p-id="64560647f38d0746605a0da7206907e0">"They're not saying no, are they? Right? They mean there's even a slight chance?"

</p><p data-p-id="6826c0c0dfdd7f601520ea1001e10ef3">Lan nodded, and tears trickled down from Sina's eyes.

</p><p data-p-id="0228dacc91502b9f66fac49295a9a6e5">"M, Mom, Mom, I miss you-"

</p><p data-p-id="eee8e6a9ff9a64ffa624a53b401718aa">Lan hugged Sina tightly, feeling her heart broken, and Sina burst into tears.

</p><p data-p-id="a91b3e780853bee1ba463529db2121a7">"Mom, mom, mom, I - miss you. Uh-huh."

</p><p data-p-id="9c277f238d2eb51efc6aa844f3cd24dc">"Unnie will help you somehow. You'll be able to go back."

</p><p data-p-id="6a719edc3b024a6d2382c5719acf145f">Lan swept Sina's back, repeating himself. Sina can't go back to normal world.

</p><p data-p-id="6152fd79fd2016334eab170d99e0ec1d">But is there a law that says you can't go back to her because everything's already changed?

</p><p data-p-id="99dd5ef193c61d4d7a7d67734545a34b">Lan's eyes were filled with tears. <br>I'll ask for everything somehow.

</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******

</p><p data-p-id="8094a1688e91a4e59f9fa1d3efbf23e6">Olivia's face, who hasn't taken off her mourning clothes yet, was pale. It was not because of sadness but because of anger.

</p><p data-p-id="533f2876bf8cc3f4e023e94454c28d1f">While looking at the mirror, she couldn't stand it and threw a perfume bottle on the dressing table and scratched the mirror.

</p><p data-p-id="b5455313bb8396b438dcc0ff8679877f">With a loud noise, an expensive mirror with silversmiths was shattered.

</p><p data-p-id="4e90a5d078558490d1d4e278da99c83a">Still, her anger didn't go away, so Olivia bit her fingertips. There was no-one in the room.

</p><p data-p-id="969393ab0ec6c66b9514185dc2adf97f">'I should have slept with Eustaf that day.' Olivia exhaled and thought.

</p><p data-p-id="8bc482e91baf72c5e5c509c2bdbc6c10">On the night of the feast of Countess Lieselotti, Olivia ran into Eustaf at the palace.

</p><p data-p-id="13e7434ba14c145d7974522e0f99ca6b">It was too good a chance to be a coincidence.

</p><p data-p-id="1b73ef3ae598912e33b1fd7499514131">He showed up without saying he would come to the palace, so Olivia pulled the hem of Yustaf's clothes under the pretext of it.

</p><p data-p-id="8ecf579fe0cdb8d56370153100ed0e90">Olivia was a beauty, and she knew how to use it.

</p><p data-p-id="7039bf44381163665c8846736b8515b2">Beauty and power.

</p><p data-p-id="687935be134217f3278b99730f00ddd0">You can get both hands on it, which man would reject it?

</p><p data-p-id="445023d16089c01d43718b78f4bdc7c4">******

</p><p data-p-id="9fbdcbb821f48ff0659ac1ecbc9e2fa8">"From the first time I saw you, I liked you."

</p><p data-p-id="31e4229ec8f6a1871f590aee9a0cf05f">Spouting sweet words, Olivia giggled and pulled his belt with her finger. Eustaf's blue eyes looked down at Olivia in the dusk.

</p><p data-p-id="75841f87c4b5318e77c5a0a932ca37fc">Olivia laughed as if she had somehow returned to her girlhood.

</p><p data-p-id="1c1ee7feb9478fea434c620dfd7e6f3e">"You can be the father of my child."

</p><p data-p-id="3d33b27fa438458f59fb2f967af7165c">Straightforwardly, not significantly, Olivia whispered with red lips.

</p><p data-p-id="89c2c96690c94d616a150758dc389b9b">"The next emperor will be your child." You get both the Empire and me.

</p><p data-p-id="b937c2ba9c9c1687631ecf017b94bb87">Olivia recalled the medicine Devan had given her. The drug that makes you definitely pregnant.

</p><p data-p-id="95ebfcb2569232a13bcad4c9cc94d0c9">One night, even if he just accidentally came over by a dizzying temptation, having a child would be his victory.

</p><p data-p-id="f399e5137c9a0e502eaaf411975b1be5">She stood up and tried to kiss him, but Eustaf pulled out.

</p><p data-p-id="d370bbc16207ba476a101ff92decfc6f">He said, taking off her finger on his belt as if it were dirty.

</p><p data-p-id="68393a30f3a970832494377344ca05a7">"I have a previous engagement."

</p><p data-p-id="94d1e4fd7d60829c71c259b610a9cf7c">"Do you have more important promises than being the ruler of the empire?"

</p><p data-p-id="6f63ae21904c005a96432423f9eabf80">When Olivia asked him with a foul mouth, Eustaf answered without hesitation.

</p><p data-p-id="bf37dc80232b1c9b5e1c95c62bdc728d">"There is."

</p><p data-p-id="604b307b69612f5373ec1b6e1e9adf6c">Then he left the room without looking back. Olivia felt her face burning with shame. So far, she has never failed because she seduced her.

</p><p data-p-id="1b3d5d0b5a3bc12499a1e0c9095bf010">And the next day, as soon as he realized that Eustaf had refused to meet her because he was on his way to a banquet for Countess Lieselotti. <br>Black jealousy and anger directed at Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="d4ba516d198c12c14d963537060de2a0">Without her, she wouldn't have been humiliated.

</p><p data-p-id="1a2935d98dd9ed0b1cd96cfd5d38a1b8">******

</p><p data-p-id="3d96d3636366f1f5c87831ba061c46f0">'If I was pregnant then, everything would be fine.'

</p><p data-p-id="48a7e94fee71537dec99b24115c6ec4f">She probably didn't have to return to her family like this.

</p><p data-p-id="1b1f3468729ac1a4895cb35518d2db88">She must have been at the height of the palace with the Duke of Miro and the Duchess of Lacia on her back and the heir of the empire in her arms.

</p><p data-p-id="6e58822d4642510593822bae4cbdd32a">'I'll never forgive you.'

</p><p data-p-id="d6a382016bb069dd8bd6d1efa8411c1b">A woman who looks innocent and pretends to be nice and seducing a man behind her. Olivia knew such a woman very well.

</p><p data-p-id="40533627b911310efbf412cae3c97f1b">Lan, if you take off that one eyelid, you'll get the same thing.

</p><p data-p-id="c41519da4611005674eb021ecd34e2b4">'And you refuse my invitation?'

</p><p data-p-id="3ce465f5cc586aa9e6c7437fb707b887">Everything Lan did, every word, kept coming to mind, fueling Olivia's anger.

</p><p data-p-id="dd49556d5e7587b41522a2285ac21cec">Because Olivia herself is and has lived among such people, she didn't really think there was anyone who didn't have a desire for power or that people were moving in good faith. If anyone really moved in good faith, Olivia was only seen as a fool.

</p><p data-p-id="052aee69efb468dc8cec0ce130376e16">Olivia believed that Lan had trampled on her and had a triumphant smile by now.

</p><p data-p-id="7cec74ccad34f0dceff6b38361c6b28a">'I'll never forgive you.'

</p><p data-p-id="ee0f3ef3c8b0fc647816a6c8dc641a7c">Olivia made up her mind again.
