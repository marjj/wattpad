<p data-p-id="6cc2bc6f0e4e11581ff79c8b97d53de0" style="text-align:center;"><b><u>Ran’s Blind Incident </u></b><br>

</p><p data-p-id="d20caec3b48a1eef164cb4ca81ba2587" style="text-align:center;">L

</p><p data-p-id="afa47f45e31d35a37b0b7f417a308933">an's determined face, Eustaf said, wrapping her cheeks. "Promise me that you will be in a safe place instead."

</p><p data-p-id="1b8ef06a924446f53aad945431e799ab">"I'll do it."

</p><p data-p-id="c691754c56dadc80b3153dbe75d1c03e">"All right."

</p><p data-p-id="6a1c6a6be0f231d3e6e1e0b894de02eb">Eustaf nodded. It was decided that she would go with him.

</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******

</p><p data-p-id="aa05470f6ad76f800893d6f1183eed0d">For a week, Lan didn't sleep well. Kiri frowned as she looked under her darkened eyes.

</p><p data-p-id="a83fbc1b34a57a1620983a3ea950a954">"Why can't you sleep when you're training so hard?"

</p><p data-p-id="fac66b9d0b3f98a37f6611d5480a32a0">"That."

</p><p data-p-id="3e24f7aa6d6082ba9ca8eb9dd45c2ba1">Lan laughed helplessly. Even though I was definitely overworking myself with training during the day, I couldn't sleep well at night.

</p><p data-p-id="71bc2334129f71d181c740deb97ed62f">Even when I fell asleep, I would wake up with a shallow sleep.

</p><p data-p-id="42b233b7d592d6ff16a706e3ea8f7b59">"Are you worried about something?"

</p><p data-p-id="3fc223af80bfabd6cd05736fb353fffd">When Dimodia asked with a worried face, Lan smiled awkwardly.

</p><p data-p-id="404a77207612f524280d2dd5e4b8113b">"No, it's just that I haven't had a good dream lately."

</p><p data-p-id="4c49a707a070f876c6bada2ebbc49e96">"What are you dreaming about?"

</p><p data-p-id="6d1e93ea880adc7bb00f76eefe3ee7a5">In Dimodia's words, Lan equivocated, "Just, oh, no."

</p><p data-p-id="1199b090efd8c94a865cb5fe1ab83dbd">No matter how hard it was, I couldn't say that Sina came and dreamed of going well with Eustaf.

</p><p data-p-id="b5439b775c3801fad328acf062ed3a17">Or Sina's dream of saying, "Give me my seat."

</p><p data-p-id="525b637ca3d40753857e128feeb2f34f">'Sina can't have done that, Sina can't have done that.'

</p><p data-p-id="8f02eeecd061d7a8076dbe35ecbb088b">Lan rubbed her tired eyes and said.

</p><p data-p-id="c6bb699aaac3e8b5d1e5098e3f6f580a">"Thanks for your concern. I'll get better soon."

</p><p data-p-id="62fedb3bac77cec358c693410addb1a4">"All right."

</p><p data-p-id="34ddc17e6cb0c70e28b89699b742b385">The two helped Lan dress without asking any more questions.

</p><p data-p-id="a34900ab811b5a66e5e430cb9a115f1c">I had to ride a horse up the mountain for a long time, so I wore several layers of clothes. And put a portable stove in both pockets.

</p><p data-p-id="22ce12f6923f0eea962092a01505c91e">'But it's definitely warm because there's a stove.'

</p><p data-p-id="636150375ad721c0a594a97e7d5a48e2">Lan came out thinking so. Eustaf looked at her face.

</p><p data-p-id="3bd7bf95277e7256dc332cd36ece985d">He had a white, expressionless face as always, but Lan was now able to tell the difference.

</p><p data-p-id="640a07779050b95aecf0bdab7b813ed3">"Would you mind coming with me?"

</p><p data-p-id="f02d43a216fa64d4f0de6ae9f1e8dcc2">Lan nodded at Eustaf's question.

</p><p data-p-id="ac13e028f6d5d394c64b3079472338a0">I'm so nervous about this day, but it doesn't make sense if I don't go with you.

</p><p data-p-id="dec19e0691c228131baa1d6baa4debf4">"Yes."

</p><p data-p-id="73a145054c87417b3d191e59b236d2c7">"You've been doing that lately, and I think you're worse today."

</p><p data-p-id="eb81698a5bf13165c5e1309addd48c9f">I haven't slept a wink all night.

</p><p data-p-id="d1077c391559a52c1c9f20e0365156a8">Lan swallowed the words and laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="e01ad21d2f7fca1302677df27bea4edc">"It's okay. It's just too much to look at."

</p><p data-p-id="66cbfe7a5f04729d9eaf4617127c3e3e">Eustaf looked at Lan as if he were penetrating and said,

</p><p data-p-id="b747648853a04aacaa1ea5a6967fc71e">"I'll put you on the horse."

</p><p data-p-id="b2c9abecebf1c52c5b09e10654ed6131">"Yes, please."

</p><p data-p-id="2bfd57205dd1bc764ec5bf99763d48e0">It was impossible for her to step on the stirrups and climb up with her athletic nerves.

</p><p data-p-id="c92557eeb5bda483e9891dc24e014ebc">Eustaf held her up and put her on the horse. I always think about it, but I don't know if the men in the world are unusually strong or if the knights are strong.

</p><p data-p-id="a26f6d1383be3ae2eddbea782ed7da39">'Even if the horse isn't that big.'

</p><p data-p-id="b1bba764b7625840f7c64f6dfe972cfb">Still, it was unusual to raise a person up and up.

</p><p data-p-id="671bf5995d72a3aaf9cdc073b92e82b0">'No, first of all, it's great to carry people.'

</p>
<p data-p-id="bf475f9c8b3384a292d6072707003aae">Lan sat on the horse thinking so. Last night, I repeatedly said I had to go to bed, but the more I did, the more my mind became dull.

</p><p data-p-id="be01377e556a4bf13c2805e0303894d6">'Should I have eaten sleeping pils?' <br>Lan took a deep breath, jokingly telling herself. I was distracted by the cold air as if It was stabbing my lungs.

</p><p data-p-id="8e7900a0abbaa3034ed77b6a1def4ea7">'Nice'

</p><p data-p-id="ff46af6c1d2181ec8588be596e750cde">She held the reins firmly and tightened the stirrup. Eustaf looked around Lan once and he was also on the horse. He raised his hand to start the horse, and Lan followed closely behind him.

</p><p data-p-id="16aa7f60f19b50c8c04216197c58096c">The way to the door didn't feel that far now that I'm used to it. Or is it because today is that day? <br>Eustaf felt that he didn't say a word of joke at all. <br>It was the same with other knights.

</p><p data-p-id="5eb7933011f2a1bf1ba3d0ced6e3e0ac">"What do you think, Master?" <br>Lumier's words brought Lan to her senses.

</p><p data-p-id="f43fd23d7a51f1487809940c0aab3866">"Oh? No, just." <br>Lan breathed lightly and smiled.

</p><p data-p-id="4438cdf787acd9f12f67810e27637409">"As the New Year approaches, I have this and that thought."

</p><p data-p-id="0bb0c98f69a90d0441bd140f9305521d">"Are you worried about something to worry about?"

</p><p data-p-id="8ced3698899466329e52d25db61a8ac2">"Worried. There's always."

</p><p data-p-id="e98e7cd64d9b909e5739623307fc66b5">Lan talked softly, and Lumiere knew it, but he pretended not to know.

</p><p data-p-id="7c4e2c407e5f3de617128da27fabbaae">"What kind of concern?"

</p><p data-p-id="15565da230507ea16a36f7dfcc3acfef">"Just one thing or another?"

</p><p data-p-id="aa002d8356601eda9edb6b1744ded19a">Lan frowned on her nose, saying so.<br><br>"Worried about winter, and the new Emperor next year-" And see Sina today.

</p><p data-p-id="6d6198e13609f1c08b631654cd2cef6e">Suddenly, Lan asked.

</p><p data-p-id="1a7409b53df77a050aa38fadb86f0aec">"Lumie"

</p><p data-p-id="4ab998b30ccb1c13c6a053be209959e4">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="17cf6d2e066f377220f9be574bf047d0">"Do you believe in fate, Lumiere?"

</p><p data-p-id="ee88b83a897eb8fa375fdc43fb7420ea">"How much?"

</p><p data-p-id="376d6dafe01dbfc96479733f2f41231e">"Fate's partner, same thing?" <br>Lumiere's scarlet eyes were drawn playfully.

</p><p data-p-id="de1983c045b32b94305144c4c6aed7c8">"Are you asking me that?"

</p><p data-p-id="b1b9f50c291a0de739550284bcfe46ea">"Oh, is that so? No, I'm sorry." <br>Lan apologized and he laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="8ebff513419f89a021e805bfb40d8925">"Well, wouldn't that depend to you?"

</p><p data-p-id="9942254b1cf1b4775c60d127f6d7e2a8">"Depends?"

</p><p data-p-id="28ea61ab3f534cf57416d383598f225e">"This is his destiny, that's how he decides."

</p><p data-p-id="73e20e37615f849de04f297b1b007b79">"I see......"

</p><p data-p-id="ffb778b2327b94186c372eabee6b6f2d">"This is just what I think." Lan smiled faintly.

</p><p data-p-id="d14fc9e0add9eb4e2bedf15a61286588">"No, it was helpful."

</p><p data-p-id="604696317f1f3fe0ede7d251b5530f59">"Why are you looking for fate?"

</p><p data-p-id="4659342babef4c3bc88341f3ce5015a5">It was Blaine who stepped in softly. Lan grinned at him.

</p><p data-p-id="fddb4c0bd5217d69bc5e3eadfe957f56">"I wonder if it exists." Blaine smirked.

</p><p data-p-id="250d68b3cf436afd3b0a1a18b91ff53e">"Have you met him already?"

</p><p data-p-id="c1ec84d21be83e59c4ace52c4d2de86c">Lan laughed but did not answer the words that came in a subtle step deep.

</p><p data-p-id="f27e52db88da9f060fe3b2d72febabb6">"Noonim." <br>At that time, Eustaf delayed his words and talked with her side by side.

</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="adefa6c8655efc7fd073c44c070993db">When Lan looked back at him, Eustaf asked. "Would you like to ride with me?"

</p><p data-p-id="d95652ca613541170fa3568fc221c72f">"Yes?"

</p><p data-p-id="7fde7a36d70253cc0b1bdca42b2c4bed">"The horse."

</p><p data-p-id="83f34e4070044a275b91b92ef39a9900">"I feel sorry for your horse, yo."

</p><p data-p-id="016345f468afe3bfab6f6e45cb9edb3f">Lan took a beat late and added a 'yo,' and Eustaf replied, "The horse is fine."

</p><p data-p-id="dd4624ddc4dbef0b8f2a20a1333a7942">Lan thought for a moment and shook her head.

</p><p data-p-id="b9a19dfbca69e4b93884384e7082b58d">"No, we have to stop."

</p><p data-p-id="d7b40968e2989aee0555853e0cca5865">It was burdensome to start moving in this winter and stop the heated horse.

</p>

<p data-p-id="6346411fa916e694896c864da9d292dd">Eustaf clenched his lips. Lan laughed.


</p><p data-p-id="5fbf562f21a7fc26b9e2b9646e1202ab">"Let's ride together when we come down instead."


</p><p data-p-id="2c92e2de908ec4af615fb87fff9b3e8e">"········Okay."


</p><p data-p-id="07b1af86cf301058e486f2f5fd66b1f2">He breathed out a long breath. <br>Even when his white breath breaks down, I feel like a pictorial, Lan glanced at his profile and thought. <br>Soon after, the party passed under the silver arch. <br>The arch was still shining, with no snow piled up. Eustaf said as the horse stopped and the knights wrapped around it so that it wouldn't cool down.


</p><p data-p-id="c335ba1c9cd97021ba11569d496be6ec">"From here, I'll go alone."


</p><p data-p-id="82f1ca758d09286bbaa2d6d219c2d69a">Lan was a little surprised, but she nodded gently.


</p><p data-p-id="0ef15e4eee756eb826beaa94e1d0e25b">She nodded so gently that Eustaf was surprised, but he whispered, "Stay still," and went into the cave. <br>Lan stood and sighed lightly. Lumiere asked, cappingly next to her.


</p><p data-p-id="74a9aa74775f01280d4a1f36fd8f2359">"Why? You don't think Lord meant to be?"


</p><p data-p-id="8298f28b6b45c73d2527d87e7cdbd239">"Lumie" <br>Lan laughed.


</p><p data-p-id="28f06fc56029dd6da0d199974f9248fe">"I think I have the right to listen."


</p><p data-p-id="155156c58cb36e0aeafdd24df2922697">"It's not like that-"


</p><p data-p-id="989c928f20dc7451922cc76a92824b35">Lan thought, what should I say? Then a small sound was heard in the distance, and Lan turned her head.


</p><p data-p-id="79d36eaf42ac01ff2e21f9d774efdd8d">"Master?"


</p><p data-p-id="7742e8c72b07ede064a9cb69f329e3c8">"Didn't you hear anything?"


</p><p data-p-id="786b013017064285cab21c6667bccce8">All the knights shut up at her words.<br><br>"Kyakkk!"


</p><p data-p-id="6062da3dcc0a3aec905491b5159320b2">It was a small scream.


</p><p data-p-id="45d804c33e1c6e517047de9cd0d61db8">"It's a person."


</p><p data-p-id="344b13e5bfa84de9b3767c0a4669a7d0">Lumiere tilted his head when Ran said.


</p><p data-p-id="f1f009832ff6ee92effe6edf6981a339">"In this season, this snow mountain?"


</p><p data-p-id="d58c99adac47a9865a9a010462f2b55d">Blaine shook his head, too.


</p><p data-p-id="4fd7bff0cb2c898458d78fc98d1453c4">"I don't think it's a person. I guess it's a slop or something." Ran spoke with emphasis.


</p><p data-p-id="f245c7b0b0b58cb2676b809de1d9464a">"No, it's definitely a person."


</p><p data-p-id="4817441b58f69c302d428f938b35e2a5">The screams became smaller and smaller, and Lan became nervous. <br>It must be Sina!


</p><p data-p-id="1619310e1b8ddbe484835d5d6d667037">Lan dragged her horse. <br>"Then I'll go alone."


</p><p data-p-id="65f2579ab5d371f7ed1115f921cdbd75">"Master!"


</p><p data-p-id="9e3942fec0adcf535c53a89a0aa9e590">"Earl!"


</p><p data-p-id="41195735ac20ee4f98cd2ae1bcd0e470">Lumiere and Blaine were embarrassed and shouted at the same time. Lan climbed up the horse's back with all her might and desperately. Lumiere grabbed her horse's reins.


</p><p data-p-id="d788ba067c15a51ee10f93725ef0b286">"Lumie, let go."


</p><p data-p-id="0a0edd865a012cef97f016cb8dac5e0e">"I won't let go. Where the hell are you-"


</p><p data-p-id="681e74fd49370e47aa5e2f4e6a2a4fa7">Lumiere was full of energy, and so was Blaine. Lan clenched her teeth.<br><br>"Get out of the way."


</p><p data-p-id="5bfc8b40e80cdb98205b490095569f37">"Okay, I'll be there." Lumiere frowned.


</p><p data-p-id="725d0d0cf6fffd72457ad5dc0556a2e9">"Really?" <br>He nodded at Lan's words.


</p><p data-p-id="d97ea29562602bf13cdef8b86e3bcfd4">"You mean people?"


</p><p data-p-id="ffe635860890807c4bcb313d2e4f55fa">"Yes, Certainly."


</p><p data-p-id="1300cc0b6411c5d1b28b883b3263dadd">Lan answered so desperately and nodded, so Lumiere quickly climbed onto his horse.


</p><p data-p-id="7691a8b121d0e273852a5e5473be6cc2">"Okay. If you do, I will."


</p><p data-p-id="e40779d450f3df4324a587ee0c7d46ac">"Sir Lumiere-"


</p><p data-p-id="0cf183e1292bbc0c8ab254f824f02804">Lumiere looked lightly at Blaine. Lan added desperately.


</p><p data-p-id="8abc465ceafe5bfb1385f9366a83ccb2">"Surely, huh? Lumiere, make sure!"


</p><p data-p-id="9ae3b03a493498289e7afaa47a049b9f">He nodded and kicked the horse in the ribs, wondering how many times he had asked. Looking at Lumiere moving away in an instant, Lan breathed out a small breath. <br>My heart was beating so fast because of nervousness. What if Lumiere doesn't find her? <br>So what if Sina goes to the wrong place again?


</p>
<p data-p-id="f4b4e340669c5ad28477111b75dcca81">"Earl, what the hell is this--"


</p><p data-p-id="d7d5504370654bdf0a52da9536bdbf1a">"It was definitely human."


</p><p data-p-id="2c7f55b14febd6f4a463a7ceb76cd746">Lan spoke firmly, so Blaine had no choice but to shut up.


</p><p data-p-id="907acc406854f9acdbf2962324ffe359">What do you mean, a human being? <br>I've never seen Lan so forced, so Blaine thought for a while and called a few more knights to help Lumiere.


</p><p data-p-id="c8c1753ea23feab3f79389aa537e6b31">A relief was engraved on Lan's face. <br>"Thanks, Lord Blaine."


</p><p data-p-id="6db1fb22acbfe6fd73f82c7606f1423c">"No. If It's really a human being, she's in a danger, so you have to help."


</p><p data-p-id="c10fec748a78cb04c78dd515ff8eaac5">And I'm going to ask you why you came in here. <br>Blaine thought so, but a low echo came from the top of the mountain. <br>It was the sound of fluffing. Lan turned her head.


</p><p data-p-id="d98d9c02d47ef3fe91a1c7f76468eb33">"Mountainhead?" <br>Blaine said in her murmur.


</p><p data-p-id="c2c3aea93f844229f192bd1e1cab8cb6">"No, that's not what I'm saying-"


</p><p data-p-id="ad1c0ddf8b32cb34f9522efd70422dab">Then something soared into the air. <br>Lan opened her mouth wide.


</p><p data-p-id="d328cfdfa066edf21df78ab2502319c5">"Fliying Masu!"


</p><p data-p-id="086e668cb055568c4972579c138d2bf7">Blaine clenched his teeth and told Lan.


</p><p data-p-id="332c6d2a74895fa3e9795f1a5f571f9b">"Get down from the horse!"


</p><p data-p-id="dbed46dde9ed159374ddcc8803f528ba">"Huh? Uh-"


</p><p data-p-id="f2a2823129a3500508bea1cfe4620fcc">Lan nodded. Lan came down from the horse and looked up at the sky. The black object must have been quite far, but it was large.


</p><p data-p-id="2bd96b021b89e5c07a8769707ae6e3dd">'What, isn't it too big ········?'


</p><p data-p-id="da752f2c35a73f97c3525644366d7444">Lan got goose bumps on her back. <br>The wings and tips of the wings seemed at least 10 meters long.


</p><p data-p-id="0cbb8c8ef1f76d12c50dcb5c7d168b35">"Dragon?"


</p><p data-p-id="e57f3b14d0b8ca28a5ad3e2063bdf4eb">Blaine said as he murmured without realizing it.


</p><p data-p-id="6908b3875a3aa7bfd8e26ebc516e504b">"No, the head part is different. Everybody down the tree!"


</p><p data-p-id="e735a6acc909f2630f50edd70f834a84">To deal with enemies attacking from above, it was most certain to hide under a tree. Lan said she could go to the cave in front of her, but it wasn't an option. Lan scrambled with the other knights and headed under the tree.


</p><p data-p-id="eb457d692a420c69608a31777cdb110d">No, I was going to head. <br>Before the body suddenly leapt up. <br>In an instant, the ground became farther away, and Lord Blaine's astounding face and shout became farther away.


</p><p data-p-id="e7a15bf11e384273086f062a5c257339">Lan realized only then that she was caught in Masu's claws.


</p><p data-p-id="d4ffdb54b2cf79d1ba6976065d3282c3">'How?'


</p><p data-p-id="aa96a31d865fb1b4de3415d1041e7e9d">This fast without any sound?


</p><p data-p-id="4a0f3d4b9f1491d420934be5d0a73927">But soon, I got goosebumps at the scene of the land, which was getting smaller very quickly.


</p><p data-p-id="79fec8f24bab377aafebba1f79b83d32">"Istarif!" <br>She screamed.


</p><p data-p-id="c208974fde28b98b4ab60ee29c470894">But no response came back. Then Masu said.


</p><p data-p-id="e994c6178043213020cf79f9da4726d2">"...No......It's.....Not........"


</p><p data-p-id="c02110bfdb9f171686ec6cfe0cba718e">As soon as I got goosebumps all over my back, Masu threw Lan.


</p><p data-p-id="bde743cce3d9a3defe94d60e9764e1ce">"-!!"


</p><p data-p-id="ae8d0be6328e9752b9203bdf25c50b5f">There was no scream. So Lan called the second name.


</p><p data-p-id="7f1cd7518db7d02e25c5101c9d7da42e">"Candral!"


</p><p data-p-id="b75c7688df64c2aeb0a98016eccbb463">It was fortunate that I remembered the name. <br>No, do you remember because this is the situation?


</p><p data-p-id="6ae7da1cb4da64bc815d72d51cbf8841">"Save me!" Pok!


</p><p data-p-id="220e9a6860fdcf2a0d1432ec6475177f">A strong shock hit the whole body, and Lan was stuck in her eyes. It hurt so much that no scream came out. But being sick means being alive. <br>When I lifted the distorted view, I could see the snake's lower body. <br>The upper body of a man, the lower body of a snake. The admiration of the Duke of Usla.


</p><p data-p-id="3c5646e38d983f7d7af2c5eefd3473ec">Candral.


</p><p data-p-id="81903b526b9cff810b600d7ba0de251d">His face was stiffened with white blood. Before Lan could say thank you, he chewed out slowly.


</p><p data-p-id="8f0cf34b80af94f60c45c5bb6e35bcd0">"The only thing that can command me is that of Usla, how dare you-"


</p><p data-p-id="8285a79475107956754181321a69c40d">'Ah'


</p><p data-p-id="d28b4a0871ffdf6c98a7f65049ca0ecb">Lan was embarrassed by the unexpected anger, and she spit it out.


</p><p data-p-id="2694430230ff86eb5a2981de6115c5e5">"I accept the price."


</p><p data-p-id="b5df59e4320a042291e9b3bea8b51e48">Then his appearance disappeared. Lan said, "Huh?" and made a small noise.


</p><p data-p-id="b9e81d5b64c7a964603b78e27883842a">'The sight...' Black.


</p><p data-p-id="b216f043564b8855bcf782eeae285311">I was so dizzy that I felt like throwing up.


</p><p data-p-id="d96c6d3992f89d1d6fb03f0e87ae5cbc">'I can't see.'


</p><p data-p-id="078792108610819952b0e097baa39ad2">My whole body hurts, and I can't see. <br>Lan laughed in vain. She closed her eyes. <br>It came up a little later, but it was also dark. There was no big difference when I closed my eyes or opened my eyes. It was the same when I rubbed my eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="333393e59e1e082cdb78ff4b406107cf">"Uk-" <br>Tears welled up.


</p><p data-p-id="113406d06674d5f621f8a96feacb4934">I could feel the tears flowing on my cheeks quickly freeze. Lan struggled to get up from her seat.


</p><p data-p-id="93123bc3e005759337ace4f48998c5c7">'Bad boy! Son of bitch!'


</p><p data-p-id="6765e7ae0274364a9be76254a3f615d1">Lan cursed inwardly. But I didn't dare to call him back. Groping through the dark darkness, Lan woke up from her seat and felt everything was at a loss.


</p><p data-p-id="d9078a4b4eca16e39c68149c4eea9e61">Which way should I go? <br>And do you think I can go? <br>'Am I going to die here?' <br>Suddenly, it felt like fate. <br>When Sina, the right main character, returns, she doesn't need herself anymore.


</p><p data-p-id="69ade59930678d87056f3fd7fe49b571">Sina perfectly inherits the position where Lan is missing. <br>Lan clenched her teeth. <br>I felt like I was going to scream. <br>Couldn't even move a few steps, Lan tripped over something. <br>My face was stuck in the snowfield, and the snow grains were stuck in my face. <br>I was sick, but I didn't feel like waking up. <br>Tears kept flowing down.


</p><p data-p-id="6ad5853f5cd9f9c7e1a50e99261732b0">'Your eyes will freeze at this rate......It doesn't matter because it's invisible anyway.' Lan closed her eyes.


</p><p data-p-id="50ee47e4ecdea05f5536c52ff1cef1aa">Lying still in the snow, the cold began to penetrate her. 'If I die.'


</p><p data-p-id="0e562783d24e0104f61bb190bd451bbb">What does Eustaf think? <br>What about Lumiere? <br>The Duchy of Lachia will be sad. <br>Lan took a deep breath and pulled up her upper body by tightening her arms. 'I'm not going to die.' Like this?


</p><p data-p-id="8f076a622c84323cec9125d0ef29563a">No, I don't want to. <br>Lan stood up and began to stutter and walk.


</p><p data-p-id="2266a93bcad2e5b43dcfd3f6babb06e7">"Istarif·······." <br>Through her frozen lips, Lan called her. I couldn't think of any other way.


</p><p data-p-id="c5d2fd6e3f28dc983b782c7db21782dd">Blue flames seemed to flutter inside the black vision, and that was the last thing Lan remembered.
