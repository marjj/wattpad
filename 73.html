"Get the soldiers in for now."

Ruth quickly rewrote the crown, and Olivia stepped back. At Ruth's words, The Servant went out the back door, and soon after, a series of Imperial Guard soldiers came in and lined up side by side on the red carpet in the Conference room.

Ruth's intention was also to choose the large conference room, which is usually not used for events, with long red carpets.

Ruth sat on the throne and said,

"Go in."

The door at the end of the room opened, and Eustaf came in.

Lightly flapping his dark navy cape, he passed lightly among the soldiers without showing any signs of flinching. Walking in moderation, Eustaf stopped walking.

"Greetings, Your Majesty."

Instead of bending his knees, he lightly touched his chest and bent down. Then he straightened his back and said,

"You're calling me, what's the matter?"

"What's going on?"

Without realizing it, Ruth pressed it and squeezed his armrest. He said, trying to find dignity.

"Are you loyal to the Empire?"

"Lazia was crowned Duke by the Emperor of Conquest, Ryan, and the friendship has never changed in the next 300 years. But, Your Majesty. Does your Majesty do the same?"

"Friendship!"

Ruth clenched his teeth. He jumped out of his seat and said,

"Hold him!"

Then the soldiers pulled out their swords, and the surprised wizard dissuaded Ruth.

"Your Majesty!"

Then a blue flame wrapped around Eustaf, and the soldiers backed away with a small scream.

The fluttering flames did not allow them to approach even an inch. However, there were no signs of soot on the carpet or marble floor.

"Blue flame..."

The wizard groaned. Eustaf walked the rest of the way and climbed one step on the stairs below the left. Ruth jumped up from his seat.

"You, you, you're rude..."

"Your Majesty."

Eustaf's tone was neither exciting nor calm. Olivia's purple eyes stared at him.

"I don't covet His Majesty's. So, if you don't touch mine, I won’t touch yours."

You won't get close, but you won't get far.

"Everything in the Empire belongs to the Emperor."

Despite a cold sweat, Ruth remained confident. His knees were shaking.

Then one of the corners of Eustaf's mouth went up. The smile that broke the expressionless face was terribly cold.

"Then you're going to fight me? For everything in the Empire?"

The blue flame burned like dancing in a circle at his feet and disappeared. Ruth's face has hardened. Neither the wizard nor Olivia swallowed without realizing it and looked at Ruth's mouth.

"He doesn’t mean to!"

Label shouted, opening the door quickly through the heavy silence. Everyone turned their heads and looked at him.

Label walked quickly and calmly smiled at Ruth.

"Brother, stop playing games. What kind of joke does the Duke of Lazia take? Don't you think so?"

Ruth couldn't figure out the situation for a moment and looked at him with a look of "What is he talking about?" At that time, Olivia cutthroat.

"That's right. The Duke was surprised because he thought you were trying to fight Lazia."

Eustaf said as he walked down the stairs, building an arsenic smile.

"I was joking, Your Majesty."

Label said,

"I was calling you to approve the title. Of course, I will approve Count Romia's title as well."

"Thank you, Prince."

With greetings Eustaf looked at Ruth and said,

"Then I'll leave you alone. Have a nice day."

Looking down lightly, Eustaf left the room. Label will be in trouble after he leaves, but it was none of his business.

'So, when I talk, in advance.'


Thinking about it, Eustaf turned to Olivia.

'I don't think that idiot would have come up with a way to poison himself.'

In addition, Olivia has already obtained contraceptives and taken them. The fact that such drugs were secretly purchased and used in the imperial palace clearly showed that she had something to do with him.

'She can handle poison.'

Eustaf thought so and looked down at his ring. Ran's words to wear the ring came to mind.

'I didn't mean to be this strong.'

I didn't know she was really thinking about catching himself.

'She's just around the corner.'

Thinking of Olivia, Eustaf thought so.

******

The first of The Viridescent Shadow looked at the second.

"The assassin's guild?"

"Yes, it was an assassin's guild in the capital. It took a while because there were a lot of backstreets doing that."

"Did the client find out?"

"I'm going to find out."

The first sighed at the second remark.

"Slow."

"That's right. They were all dead, so it was hard to find a clue."

"I heard you had someone saved."

The second looked sad at the first word.

"He killed himself quite quickly. Poor thing."

The second one was dressed in black hair and a man. he was The Viridescent Shadow, who went to meet Ran before. First, he groaned low.

"Because the Lord is sensitive to her safety."

"That's why I hated reporting until I found out who was behind it. Who knew we'd be putting it off this long?"

The first muttered, "You're not getting in trouble," when the second laughed.

"Maybe I'd like to add another escort besides Dimodia."

"Instead of the old maid?"

"If Ms Ran permits."

The first breathed again at the second remark.

"I'll be back to report for now."

"Good Luck."

The second said with a grin. The first one swallowed a sigh again. The history of The Viridescent Shadow is long, and pride is different.

However, even if it's The Viridescent Shadow, it can't stand the financial difficulties. The spies of The Viridescent Shadow work in the mountainous area, but they cost money. During the 300-year peace with the Empire, the Lazian family steadily reduced the budget for green forests, and the last financial crisis hit hard.

It was only now that the gold coins were poured out in large-scale to save The Viridescent Shadow.

Of course, it was faster than building a new group because of its roots, but it was still insufficient. Even so, the delay in the initial report is no excuse, so the first one left the room thinking that he wanted to turn his choice around.

******

Eustaf returned faster than expected and Ran met with him gladness.

"Eus!"

However, his expression was not good, so Ran, who was coming near, faltered.

"Eus? Are you okay?"

When Eustaf saw Ran faltering, he smiled and opened his arms wide, and Ran ran and hugged him tightly.

"I'm back."

"What happened? What did the Emperor say? Or-"

"It's going to be a little longer." Eustaf muttered like that.

On his way back from the palace to the green arch, the report he heard from The Viridescent Shadow in the carriage was enough to anger Eustaf.

Why didn't you tell me anything earlier?

Besides, you still haven't identified a client.

It was a waste of money for The Viridescent Shadow, and I almost spit it out without realizing it.

Eustaf gently swept Ran's face with both hands. Ran looked up at him with a curious face.

'What happened at the palace?'

"Didn't the Emperor approve the title?"

"No, it's approved. And Ran's."

"Then what's the problem?"

Eustaf should not have said there was an assassin who was after her, but he hesitated for a moment. But I finally decided to say it.

He chose her as his partner, and then he'd have to be honest. Ran hasn't made a choice yet.
