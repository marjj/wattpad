<p data-p-id="2f586c4d45f09198f3537164e903722b">The dream of standing in a white space.

</p><p data-p-id="87fd014280b841d2eb7e8e9a203ffffb">It doesn't distinguish between top and bottom, but strangely realistic.

</p><p data-p-id="3a9f3def0c72148906b29777077562f8">"Eastarif."

</p><p data-p-id="5d48e17c276c5e6c939ee4db97f4db50">When Ran called, a blue flame burned between the fog.

</p><p data-p-id="164c88038fee54d09415cdb3e0ae07bb">"Since when did humans call my name so recklessly?"

</p><p data-p-id="44579c7f34683f6205ae6a119c65ceb2">The voice that seemed to burn the flame was still there. The lion's lower body, the female's upper body, and the hair is a fiery flame.

</p><p data-p-id="2562baed12fa344dbe41a04508dfff78">She was eating with fruit in her hand. Bonnie it was the fruit that Ran prepared.

</p><p data-p-id="72cb391fdeb624345f49af32a1350e58">"I called you, but you didn't answer, so I thought you weren't coming."

</p><p data-p-id="aa6fde32b551c243f0950948a96a3aa8">"Do we have to jump out when humans call us?"

</p><p data-p-id="bc55bb25ea2a1c1ec68febe15c1c2847">"Is the fruit delicious?"

</p><p data-p-id="85f647d2cf05b3144bbd4ac740201879">When Ran asked, Eastarif swallowed fruit and laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="afcc33360560ff494475e927e958ba3d">"These fruits don't suit my taste. You're a reader, a rare stranger, be lucky I don't hate you."

</p><p data-p-id="0792101c7efa3f2eca910b64383928fb">Somehow, Ran looked bad and said, looking at her.

</p><p data-p-id="290f1056771ca2a4e9051e384ac49b8e">"Thank you for coming."

</p><p data-p-id="a9ebcd17cf5bd2c62ef0faace00e5c07">"Yeah, what's going on?"

</p><p data-p-id="8a8fa52084d1f190ec68bfb3ee605a77">"I want to ask you a question. That's over the ice."

</p><p data-p-id="254a88ef9894129a1c0e07febf0e0206">Even before Ran's words were finished, Eastarif's hair was blazing. Lan saw it and swallowed her saliva and said.

</p><p data-p-id="24a15977f132dcf1130f1c0f7ab662bd">"Delphanto, you know?"

</p><p data-p-id="952996400082a0ff6071055dda4b8896">Eastarif's face is distorted. The split pupil looked scary like a star sapphire.

</p><p data-p-id="658bf374560c06e68df1f1f2f2acc075">"I haven't heard that name in a long time. Yeah, I know about the door."

</p><p data-p-id="98f73012f9a8d1d66034ee9da1a179eb">"Is there any way to stop him from coming out?"

</p><p data-p-id="9806bda9b80d06eb3c79117537fec731">At the words, Eastarif said in a brief silence.

</p><p data-p-id="0057aa344f7cf2d163a03959e8b1f5c8">"None. Seal is always a seal. It's not a solution."

</p><p data-p-id="b169edccbb53965c57b144f3d4c277d7">"Then how do we defeat them?"

</p><p data-p-id="ea8bf6d6dc9ef67e972e08dddfa6da4b">"I don't know."

</p><p data-p-id="f09e6df82fdcab3119d71f786aaa3fa5">Ran opened her mouth wide.

</p><p data-p-id="285cddb0d62a9042d6a64545f8ea08ea">Eastarif turned around. She mumbled, scratching the ground several times with the lion's front feet.

</p><p data-p-id="8f9c5c52c3bae0d37e5ce35a8c289926">"Iveria sealed him to reduce his power. But it's a thousand years, a thousand years, or a thousand years already a thousand years."

</p><p data-p-id="fe096a0131cd82a84a7c63b4d7accad1">"What about you?"

</p><p data-p-id="009b1fb69e9744e3f9c6644f3b4ae39c">When asked by Lan, Istarif turned her neck 180 degrees and looked back, and Lan held back the scream. I've been thinking about it for a long time, but I hope you think about the human heart.

</p><p data-p-id="f87c500a3f6d7f1b35a7923c16c792a9">"I need the strength and vitality of the Lachia Lord to use my strength."

</p><p data-p-id="782d699840b2e0982a344a14d2691427">Eastariff pushed out the red floor and suffered from her lips.

</p><p data-p-id="afe4c8b202950142affc2712cf42ec68">"If you eat it all, well?"

</p><p data-p-id="77af11a332076abeefcc3b4d8a553e05">"Then I'll rule that out."

</p><p data-p-id="981d13cb3adc415ca57899e54c33141c">Lan replied quickly.

</p><p data-p-id="78f59797e49662e5875faec0b0b0de60">There is no need for an answer to Eustaf's life.

</p><p data-p-id="7d659f1a355cfaca6ded60fd217be9fe">'And what do you mean, well?'

</p><p data-p-id="f2bc1b7a07d495668a6519c7d4cb8d3a">You're not even sure, are you?

</p><p data-p-id="fe28f9e28487fccb6fa5d8a5b005ea25">Lan crossed her arms. Eastarif stepped back lightly and bouncy. So with your neck turned 180 degrees.

</p><p data-p-id="c096270ef0e31e458761d8f496d87809">Eastarif laughed when she saw Lan scared.

</p><p data-p-id="3df0268baba91d9bc82bc7b43679c55c">"Have you changed your mind? What is it? You used to be confused."

</p><p data-p-id="ce513b01f7937ab8ee3eb22737d6c379">"I like Eustaf."

</p><p data-p-id="ed746328b387b6034bfe7414b015ed33">Lan spoke frankly and Eastarif blinked.

</p>
<p data-p-id="35efb140f577bd8775bedba364bdd58c">"Who's trying to kill you?"

</p><p data-p-id="e53075dbe43ce3a45525acc0ee5c51ea">"Not anymore."

</p><p data-p-id="c033be1eefedcf3880713fdfdc59d531">At Lan's words, Istarif turned and her neck returned to position.

</p><p data-p-id="884985a78a25078562105051fed9f85a">"I don't understand. I'm not sure about that feeling. So is Iveria. So did Delphanto."

</p><p data-p-id="032af3a238674552571980d2ddb49882">Slipping past Eastarif's murmur, Lan asked.

</p><p data-p-id="443d8c648158411d3c5efb63c9c95948">"I also saw that Iveria left magic in the Viridescent Crown. <br>Do you happen to know what magic is? Wouldn't that help?"

</p><p data-p-id="7267051983eb062c29ad94bf9428defd">"In the crown?"

</p><p data-p-id="e15174f4418fc2262088f6b00134b019">"Yes" <br>Eastariff blinked.

</p><p data-p-id="454661d923a8c072ba66ecb2659ff65f">At that time, the background changed to snow field. Lan looked around in surprise. <br>It was snow at night. Nearby, there was a tent and a bonfire behind her back.

</p><p data-p-id="0e3ac327768cdda2ff857bb3f5d98244">"What the--"

</p><p data-p-id="5695b6c179b88bdc854f5d97c7f2372b">Lan muttered, and the door of the small tent opened and a person came out.

</p><p data-p-id="a73819a9d1eaba373bc5b081eec76050">"Youth?"

</p><p data-p-id="80079bfe96b39387becc608518942143">Lan shouted in surprise, but he seemed unable to hear the sound from this side. <br>Lan looked around in embarrassment, but Eastariff was not seen.

</p><p data-p-id="0d2e7b66cbf478b8bcf0bcb396c898b0">"Istarif!"

</p><p data-p-id="297b1a77c0c678845a12c8ddbda6d972">There was no answer even when I shouted.

</p><p data-p-id="f382b57f6cb5319bf2afcd1f4af2cefe">Beep!

</p><p data-p-id="3b2580e90b1333182ddbad86b830f6ff">At that time, there was a whistle that tore her ears, so Lan stepped back, covering both ears.

</p><p data-p-id="6e7d8dea9e176fe31d41d886c953736d">-   Guwoo

</p><p data-p-id="10ab2b79c768606bf0f7295c0552c11e">In the distance, there was a strange sound as if a giant bear were crying. <br>Blue Knights quickly began to come out of the tent, and the view turned black.

</p><p data-p-id="bde743cce3d9a3defe94d60e9764e1ce">"-!!"

</p><p data-p-id="14b4ab10c41b08cc55a32ccf47cc7160">Lan woke up from a dream. <br>Lan shivered as she breathed with her shoulders.

</p><p data-p-id="a48b5abcfbd7466a273e0e19ec09ea81">'What, I'm sick......'

</p><p data-p-id="d4a9d27e1d91797de89719595e21ce51">She frowned. I've been sick as if I had a flu.

</p><p data-p-id="080db5968e3808bd0b1f126fe65b0454">-   That's what happens when you get something from theSpirit.

</p><p data-p-id="1553cf62553b2e75430036f1ce8421b8">Someone whispered in her ear and Lan turned her head. A blue flame as big as a thumbnail fluttered lightly and disappeared.

</p><p data-p-id="ab4b2d19d6f902a1cea2677f4030888a">"You didn't even answer the right questions-" Lan felt irritated.

</p><p data-p-id="5e4b8c94f6b1c90b25c2efef72668b0f">'Is the last scene the present?'

</p><p data-p-id="2273cc40d233bc6a3599e8c83676bd4b">Lan bit her lips. She had never seen the actual appearance of monster. I just felt like It was a monster.

</p><p data-p-id="17479d8249035c83bc7fe888a41e9896">'That was really creepy.'

</p><p data-p-id="d0ece9f4548484177721ba34f94dc356">Eustaf and Lumiere fight those kinds of things?

</p><p data-p-id="4f14d16d97dae8a57206c6322c9380b5">Lan curled up. <br>It was a night when I couldn't fall asleep.

</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******

</p><p data-p-id="143c133f066a5d9daac8094edc73f7a7">Eustaf pulled out a sword. <br>Black and sticky blood burst out. The unpleasant, rotting smell of the body vibrated.

</p><p data-p-id="71ecf41515df5f0d46fe9635459a84ea">"It's like that before, and I think it's something that sticks to death."

</p><p data-p-id="be2a82b44bc244ec0b59b231e8f212fa">Lumiere murmured. His tone was light, but his face was hard. <br>The fallen bear-shaped beast looked at least a month old. But it's less corrupt because it's winter. <br>Crying with a strange sound, the bear was looking for someone.

</p><p data-p-id="546051bae2950d9b0b5b14ff988a7feb">- She, Where...She.... <br>That was what the bear said.

</p><p data-p-id="7fb9c7451ff04cc7423acea2e2c2128c">Lumiere and Eustaf also strangely recalled "Lan" in the words.

</p><p data-p-id="01990ce79fbc065eb8a2f8b18e218a52">It may not be Lan. Maybe he's looking for someone else. <br>In fact, other members of the Knights also seemed not to think of Lan at all.

</p><p data-p-id="2637da50e3e01460853e2bbe7da14c08">"What the hell is this monster?" <br>When asked by Blaine, Eustaf said.

</p>
<p data-p-id="a439f6f66a4cd91366492d70661332be">"Maybe I'll talk to the Wizard's Association." Blaine nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="0863faff07becade90cae56c13b607c5">"I think that would be good."

</p><p data-p-id="caf07f785fd1660125743476b81f4109">He glanced at Eustaf's sword. There was no blood left on the black blade.

</p><p data-p-id="acd6b520cfbf6ee5c3b58b4ff2118ca8">"You're all asleep. Go to the next place and rather to sleep during the day. "

</p><p data-p-id="b8dac56858ba2d23ce83f283e60b7e8b">Blaine replied briefly to Eustaf's words, "Respect."

</p><p data-p-id="445023d16089c01d43718b78f4bdc7c4">******

</p><p data-p-id="722a79511a40c07a97a5a52c3928bcf4">Winter hunting was longer than expected, so the joy was greater when they returned to the mansion. <br>When Lan said that the banquet was ready, the Knights cheered. <br>As soon as I washed up, everyone ate and drank at the banquet hall until they were sick of it.

</p><p data-p-id="ec4993ae46cf971e22ee210ad9587075">He drank wine like water and swallowed meat like jelly, wondering how long it had been since the right food had been eaten. <br>Lan was tired of the amount they ate and felt proud.

</p><p data-p-id="c0feacc400e9331893436246267f0f79">"How did you know?"

</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="eff74135349935681bf07059a659547a">"Time for us to come back." <br>Lan laughed at Eustaf's words.

</p><p data-p-id="63ec198ae4ebc47d615ae3bf12582775">"That was close. Most of them were made in advance and frozen outside. And I just heated it up. Eustaf said it's later than the time you're coming back. And just in case, there's no contact when he's back."

</p><p data-p-id="1942cc97e762e5e6c018b6b923c08fd6">Lan said Eustaf, pulling his arm around her waist.

</p><p data-p-id="5f6bd363aa1b364d98e4b63612eab6ea">"I can't wait to see you in person any sooner."

</p><p data-p-id="033e6035c32dbe1ee70019ab87e0f1b7">"That's it. So am I."

</p><p data-p-id="43b845596cbb4e3292b5380104ec8b34">Lan said so and laughed. When Eustaf kissed, it tasted like sweet wine.

</p><p data-p-id="6e7f502a9d87b0e8c8f5077ee5e28209">Lan smiled and slipped his shoulder and said. <br>"Everyone's watching."

</p><p data-p-id="2e0afca297f410ca653c39a6d0d27b34">"No one's watching."

</p><p data-p-id="6f26b12fb38230107d1a850bcc00726f">"No way."

</p><p data-p-id="dddbd347857605b053a2a4524d672352">Lan said so and looked at the banquet hall. The rapid decrease in food in the beginning also began to slow down. <br>The servants also looked more relaxed.

</p><p data-p-id="763595582a5be929228c18db19a77cc1">"Have you looked at the Viridescent Crown?"

</p><p data-p-id="d9968dd069a6025fe9e1c912e1f4621c">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="1547ebc8e27c66db0996703f5cbbd962">"Did you like it?"

</p><p data-p-id="30ab4dafab1357e379171006ee4deab9">"Eustaf"

</p><p data-p-id="5655914262dddb44d022ae163146340a">"Or do you like the new tiara?"

</p><p data-p-id="7036663ea477eba51a0d81294f011943">"You know that's not what I meant." <br>Lan quickly continued.

</p><p data-p-id="5f80609b7f84df808aac63d3fdb887fd">"I haven't found any magical traces. I wonder if it was just a joke after all....." Lan hesitated.

</p><p data-p-id="750d034660100b0d4b884db5021f86a7">When talking about the crown, Eastar Leaf definitely turned things around and glossed over. In addition, after two days of public illness, Lan stopped thinking of calling Istarif again. <br>But there's definitely something in the crown.

</p><p data-p-id="7fe55c1b37b3c9505ad71c8fa2885395">'But to tell you this story, you have to say that you know the name of Eastarif.'

</p><p data-p-id="58feee5ec2544be37a19f747d6ff237f">What would Eustaf think if she said that? <br>Won't they be prying?

</p><p data-p-id="d0541246b2a435ed0e72c2ef4a121da4">"Actually, I have a confession to make to Youth." With a serious face, Eustaf looked around.

</p><p data-p-id="781f03636e5637545f18596c0b16d3ac">"Let's move for a moment."

</p><p data-p-id="de628d0ff27cfb77ee883e87bc56ae57">Lan nodded at his words. Yeah, it's not something to talk about at the banquet.

</p><p data-p-id="fd3689ef1f347f840919a59b6abc5baa">Coming out of the banquet hall, Lan and Eustaf went into a small room. <br>Lan took a deep breath and said.

</p><p data-p-id="a7e72584523ca4b8dccd0a66a3ee86cb">"So, I'm actually. I know the name of blue flame." Eustaf stared silently at Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="d1b3d9c3e7f9790b20f7c5358de8826d">Lan couldn't look at him properly and continued quickly.

</p><p data-p-id="ed56817a47cc24e2ba09676e648641c0">"That, that's why I was able to get a ring. I can't tell you how I got to know his name. And I can't tell you the name. <br>Well- the spirit hates it."

</p>
<p data-p-id="e0377273ed3f61fdb26ebedb482f5178">Lan lowered her head more deeply. <br>"I'm sorry."

</p><p data-p-id="ec9e48e2ad7041601d500b65c2e1478c">"What do you mean?"

</p><p data-p-id="18915b31ecb2fda13fee48c03c937e46">"Well, it's important, but I hid it. It's about ring....." Lan looked up at Eustaf carefully. Eustaf did not look angry.

</p><p data-p-id="1a654e85bfe966e67829b4a42c85b621">Just he asked like this. <br>"Is that the reason you're telling me that now?" Really? Are we moving on to this?

</p><p data-p-id="786851bbc87498f0dd1ce378e649c026">Lan thought so, but quickly said, Don't miss the timing.

</p><p data-p-id="709d10fea512862fb01eb7022072dee0">"I called in a blue flame and asked. Does she know anything about the crown? But she changed the subject." Eustaf's forehead narrowed.

</p><p data-p-id="82f08f366bf9896cd4d4fe4ab60dd5e4">"You called blue flame?"

</p><p data-p-id="6d972b6124de6fc30a09b41a159ee4b9">"Oh, yes."

</p><p data-p-id="513da80a96650b61c294917bc01e7c0c">"Do you know how dangerous that is?"

</p><p data-p-id="6cbffe296eb3fd57e46ec7d86f28cc71">"I know that the Spirit demands a price...." Lan's word tail shrank slightly.

</p><p data-p-id="b07d39a65b70bfea971543610c34c64c">"I know."

</p><p data-p-id="46f12d1e3f435178bca16006120e6817">Eustaf's voice subsided and became slippery.

</p><p data-p-id="7d9303df1d9516d2cac88e6362f4d694">"Should I tell you more about the people who were beaten up by the Spirit in front of me, or should you get a promise not to call the Spirit again?"

</p><p data-p-id="9008d58763b3e0e561fa8ef6663e3f87">I didn't know Lan, but doing business with spirits here was a similar concept to using 'private bonds'.

</p><p data-p-id="6e92e65ba02cb50284ead2e2e4619ffe">In order to trade with the Spirit, you must ask and trade what you want first, or the Spirit will ask for absurdity. <br>However, most of them were in a desperate situation, and there was a lot of talk about borrowing the power of the spirit and later using the force of the spirit.

</p><p data-p-id="54a943ee955372f6dbe64b8fa235fac7">However, Lan, who was not familiar with it, thought, 'How could you be so angry?' but answered calmly.

</p><p data-p-id="65c931323998df2491f60de3b542024b">"I know." <br>Eustaf's blue eyes narrowed.

</p><p data-p-id="d5628a13b3e08a2e5df2c64b2026fa02">"I understand why you were so confident going to a dangerous place. It must have been a very complacent idea that you could borrow the power of blue flame. It's called blue flame, but it's a spirit, too." Eustaf held her hand tightly.

</p><p data-p-id="2df1ec5e777003e23bb089a503448137">"You promise not to using."

</p><p data-p-id="a5ec2b5222e7d45f8d405d9d14fe6005">"Yes." <br>Lan nodded. I don't think I'll get an answer even if I ask more questions to Estarif anyway....

</p><p data-p-id="19ec3ff080b0c781502ba32a4ce1f8fc">'You don't have to upset Eustaf for nothing.'

</p><p data-p-id="9a484cf328e5e94661c274f4bdd793b0">In response to Lan's answer, Eustaf then let go of her hand and hugged her and kissed her.

</p><p data-p-id="5078f6f125a49e1613e663654f786d2a">"I'm telling you, I'm thinking about where and what else I can do to keep Lan safe."

</p><p data-p-id="47cafcf5f1057d9cda88ace6417c16b4">Enclosed in his arms, Lan laughed. <br>"I don't think we can be any safer. Of course - something suspicious is coming out these days." Eustaf's face darkened by her backstabbing.<br><br>He spoke low. <br>"I'm going to the closing ceremony next week."

</p><p data-p-id="623d80c0339e9ebba91e5260a2097418">"Already?"

</p><p data-p-id="6ee8a7ccd42def2747df6ba8a0bb49fb">"It's not too early. Because winter hunting was long."

</p><p data-p-id="17bbed2ced626507df0e32176be38742">In the words of Eustaf, Lan said, 'Is that so...' she breathed out a short breath.

</p><p data-p-id="073e84d030ff1a239fffddb7e01d6001">'Then that's the day Sina comes.' It really came today.

</p><p data-p-id="1d3be679398684e351752af7e0d48c0f">After all that time, the time has finally come when the original work begins. Well, it's not the original, it's just what she read.

</p><p data-p-id="9a23b97228126f1cd9e31d1b4b55a5fd">"Would you like to come with me? Or...."

</p><p data-p-id="aec7311783b42bd7efcdc1e4abf7086a">He raised Lan's head with a blur of hindsight.

</p><p data-p-id="440d948dbc8c224dfce5ac2592fd6d30">"Of course I'll come with you!" replied, Lan added,

</p><p data-p-id="8714c713dc224cca38a067ad5178d90c">"Don't you want to go-?"

</p><p data-p-id="3c7113932cf3f6d797560342a94c8d9f">Are we finally on the flow? <br>Is it that kind of a world that tries to keep her away from himself and leave him alone with Sina? <br>I kept thinking like that even though I knew it was paranoid. Like a mole digging a way to escape.

</p><p data-p-id="cebc2bc747e52f42ca32c757182b88be">'But it's scary.'

</p><p data-p-id="9dcb4d12042e8d77ab16a6c6eca56474">What I read is a complete happy ending. <br>It's a flawless end. But if you keep playing it like this, maybe it'll be a bad ending. <br>Maybe Eustaf gets hurt or something happens. <br>Lan's face darkened and Eustaf said, holding her in his arms.

</p><p data-p-id="f5351430198fd09ba3623916e050368b">"No, it's not because it's hard for you to ride a horse in the winter."

</p><p data-p-id="36224163b1a6e579d6a2b120aa6291f1">Actually, I didn't want to take her near the door. I don't want to take Lan near the danger in it.

</p><p data-p-id="485a9c3ed9ec75e8ab4c00109a7bb54d">Eustaf sighed and said, <br>"Let's go together."

</p><p data-p-id="aae6c4745d13a54c684f90a6a7b64871">"Yes." <br>Lan answered quietly in his arms.

</p><p data-p-id="016d8e92b3c683dd7610c1a84275f9c0">Anyway, she had to see and meet. <br>Sina is coming to this world.

</p><p data-p-id="cc2b519c1662a2910023453119db773e">'And this time, she'll be chased by monsters and help her before she suffer in the snow.' Lan decided so.

</p><p data-p-id="addd879bf10907fd76bcb975ef1775d1">From what I read, Sina comes to this world, wanders tremendously, is chased, and barely meets Eustaf. <br>At least I wanted to make sure it didn't happen this time.

</p><p data-p-id="9d2501da94921048ee1949cce0918aac">At first, I wanted to stop her from being treated harshly by the Duchy of Lacia.
