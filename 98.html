<p data-p-id="b3d5e6b6d9f977a08c9be22959be16f9">Devan frowned.

</p><p data-p-id="73f978f553b22d63463722ca1ad6f1bb">He couldn't understand his sister at all.

</p><p data-p-id="0d2e7c3a4e69ccdac1c2b29a3a0edc65">Of course, it was heartbreaking that her husband died. I understand her sadness.

</p><p data-p-id="048563c3d8aee61de6a8ceb83602ee3f">'But he wasn't a good husband.'

</p><p data-p-id="f2197a02f63ce88cc9f3b1e227101568">It may not be as good as the emperor of the Empire, but the queen of the kingdom was being considered for a second job.

</p><p data-p-id="4572baecfa55f23e74158c9a4397b2d5">'Because you're still young, you don't want to be too concerned, and it would be good to marry a new marriage with your husband.'

</p><p data-p-id="6896bc56d12cda7df989c25af64d5fc9">Devan was still heartbroken to think that Olivia hadn't been out of bed for days after Ruth's death.

</p><p data-p-id="526c43b7666d8cda830ba416246be22b">Afraid of losing his sister, who raised her like a daughter, he begged her to get up and eat something, and Olivia held such a brother's hand tightly and said.

</p><p data-p-id="63fb13cfe606e738b6ff57d14153b3dc">"It's because of that girl."

</p><p data-p-id="b25bb7ccc68d70b029b8568f2eb6e93f">The sunken purple eyes shone in shape.

</p><p data-p-id="bb4211282cba8ef04053a8658cc1c88c">"It's because of Lacia!"

</p><p data-p-id="6b6f7f97a6d66df1982b6c9cfb9d7f01">Devan had no idea why it was so connected.

</p><p data-p-id="996ea74647f56547d8249c151ff1b4ee">Of course, there was a minor confrontation in society, but the direct cause of Ruth's death was the overdose of drugs.

</p><p data-p-id="634951e25679bb1976368dc538d441c5">His pet, Cortizan, and her mansion were playing around again and died drinking from alcohol.

</p><p data-p-id="2d183b305ba6cb9740e1ec246039ac09">Even when he was naked, what he did, his genitals were cut and covered in blood. Because of that, it was murder at first. However, the investigation found evidence that Ruth was using drugs and wielding a knife on his own.

</p><p data-p-id="d0fbb00ee92bbbaff2bbbe40352ae55f">It was a very pathetic death to be called the emperor of the empire.

</p><p data-p-id="baa2d005ecba37954d65aa099f6d5609">Everyone was hissing, but the rumor was already spread enough, and Devan cut down Cortizan and her child with his own hands.

</p><p data-p-id="76f32706e0b3ecc10eae8df6cd59fbf7">"I'm coming in."

</p><p data-p-id="bbc929a1a1fe8ee6646e12381acb2dd7">"Come on in," replied Olivia.

</p><p data-p-id="8bc10792322ec176f1c7777a0f648ea1">She was staying at the Miro duke's mansion.

</p><p data-p-id="40d93e302930d26a062a450eea8b743b">Olivia's appearance, which was wrapped around her whole body with mourning clothes, seemed to be at stake, and at the same time there was something chilling.

</p><p data-p-id="28933bfddf6508ac9d30e6df73eab1a8">"Are you sure this is gonna work?"

</p><p data-p-id="2d1dfb37a58e349aa351d2ed2cdb3e55">At Devan's words, Olivia smiled seductively with her red lips.

</p><p data-p-id="40789d1e4cab5ff743829e70f2d0d86c">"Yes. Did you save it?"

</p><p data-p-id="a78f1701a5f3825a8703b90fe7c3d723">"Yes, but- I don't think I'm that reliable. As you know, the immigrants-"

</p><p data-p-id="f01f6547713a395e1bcf611f44757ab0">"It's all right. I'll take care of it."

</p><p data-p-id="ed71e380c5da9cd167be385a51c3cbd9">Olivia got up from her seat and hugged Devan.

</p><p data-p-id="2f8b149d5a11dfd405c812d2475b0b87">"Thank you, brother. I know you're overdoing it because of me."

</p><p data-p-id="acea14c1d7239de60b01eb8e206f1d34">Devan sighed and patted her on the back.

</p><p data-p-id="3e9c661af1da404738dc36108cb12adc">"What's hard for you? But I can do it for you. Even if you don't."

</p><p data-p-id="43c0e4a615f66e0d6205f0d0efb963ee">"I really want to do it with my own hands. Then I'll get married again where I want to."

</p><p data-p-id="5cbf5edc084762518154be3cfcb51e69">"Olivia."

</p><p data-p-id="5b946d1d2ceb076b1a0a3091443abe59">Devan carefully called his sister.

</p><p data-p-id="7c9bb033e786d9f13f170e67fd1f4f32">"If you don't want to, don't look elsewhere, not for the kingdom."

</p><p data-p-id="e9428b48daedd7eebf2ae508d0ea5396">Olivia opened her mouth slightly and shook her head.

</p><p data-p-id="31329de55bae2dbf5df3740aaae9fec9">"No, I can't live with my head up in the Empire."

</p><p data-p-id="9790cf59290c570f6ba272b839579363">Devan tried to say something, but Olivia took off first and smiled.

</p><p data-p-id="d94fa223f0f118d30b6fb19eee95f2cd">"Then let him in."

</p><p data-p-id="06c1f9b23c16ff656a7f047024f81006">Devan sighed and nodded. Olivia grinned when she saw him go out.

</p><p data-p-id="526bf69fa3bf33ab6f5ac691a08226c6">I know Devan cares about herself, but the biggest affection he can do is to send his younger sister, herself, to a good marriage.

</p>

<p data-p-id="32cc518971a882b767d3330fb585bfff">'But the best marriage is gone.'

</p><p data-p-id="09d10dd1a6a31ef8bf12d82588b33b10">Empress Dowager of the Empire. <br>The position belongs to her. <br>Olivia's high self-esteem was deeply hurt.

</p><p data-p-id="e665567ae3b6bf4b82c7ea1a8cf51229">There was definitely a solid road ahead of her. Olivia was steadily climbing the stairs.

</p><p data-p-id="b769441cfa9f5ab0fac243e13fb52996">Until the girl showed up.

</p><p data-p-id="7e4913bdfbb84760e6948c20b0e10e73">'You think you won.'

</p><p data-p-id="d82bb990feae228bb3e72739b3134515">Olivia smiled a fishy smile.

</p><p data-p-id="e2977f641ca18d3d56301216e86e299e">You take over the Duke of Lazia, and you think your world is open now?

</p><p data-p-id="09b3c08d78903fd15d2a859fdbef8030">You would have heard that Olivia herself seduced him.

</p><p data-p-id="3b712cc2bcb7e41a80af5d0c5b301b0f">Lan's laughing face was clearly drawn on Olivia.

</p><p data-p-id="eccbac937fdde2d415d1edf5fd4c738f">'But I'm the last one to win.'

</p><p data-p-id="8feb920e3592fe253c5000d435006cc3">After a while, the door opened and a small person with a cloth covered his whole body came in.

</p><p data-p-id="f782ef1316b73469497acdd9b5282c19">Olivia smiled softly and said.

</p><p data-p-id="3a1381bb405fe8911ea5cbb9499f292c">"Are you from the old Travan kingdom?"

</p><p data-p-id="6bc696f71c4ab5c51668510e0f09b8b6">"That's right."

</p><p data-p-id="5392729ca0490416306ad0b35f03afc0">Olivia smiled more and said, although she felt contemptuous about the strong accent.

</p><p data-p-id="a1d482f72487f42ab3a608733fdf0551">"I hear you can control anything you want."

</p><p data-p-id="7ecb72a1b1ab06fb3b885556a1a79101">"Not everything."

</p><p data-p-id="b7632ade37d687f7e7aa9c3b03ed68fe">"I heard you can handle animals and humans?"

</p><p data-p-id="74d6bfd1a96a7925dd7cf8e494ec000f">"Yes, that much... is possible, although... there are conditions."

</p><p data-p-id="5f968facc23f982417e6e3daed9cc3a3">Olivia smiled broadly. <br>"Then that's enough. We need to talk a little bit."

</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******

</p><p data-p-id="e53a229a29cabfe06005f5a7d2e5fb4e">Sina opened the carriage window wide. The spring breeze in the capital was pleasant and a little hot.<br><br>"What a difference in temperature. Lazia can't run with the wagon window open, though." Lan nodded at Sina's words.

</p><p data-p-id="87dbfe52d093ca59159c61181fa1a795">"It's much warmer."

</p><p data-p-id="dec19e0691c228131baa1d6baa4debf4">"Yes."

</p><p data-p-id="009b1f55f4eb9d2c2c49d90c5391d34f">"And I heard it got warmer faster this year."

</p><p data-p-id="be6fcd74ff7f142a0dd94ed0e3753465">"Is it warming?"

</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="c4d45b9aeb1123e9a2d057c1e8cd79c2">"No, that's not stupid."

</p><p data-p-id="c95b75c425d32be7d28caafc75c007e4">Sina smiled and shook her hand. Lan slightly pressed what she wanted to say, 'I know that,' and turned away from the window.

</p><p data-p-id="5493ee981d1b2c48d095588123813ec8">"Look, it's Redwood Road."

</p><p data-p-id="66417dddd8728ffd74abbf8a0ca7dfc4">"Wow-, it's like a fantasy."

</p><p data-p-id="6a9508c540a4f417a5d2dcf8de112beb">Sina felt her hips rattling on their own. She followed her to the capital city to see the capital city as well as to meet the wizard in person.

</p><p data-p-id="53fe01c9c0ad704b62c1f07a2e35705e">Wizard cannot enter Lazia. <br>But it doesn't matter if it's the capital, so we were going to meet there. Sina has not given up hope yet, and so has Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="2c4a64571b30593b39267c3ea334feec">Lan clenched his fist, burning with a sense of duty to send Sina back. <br>The green arch of spring was still beautiful, and the green arch also shone brilliantly in the spring sun.

</p><p data-p-id="f19756ddc71de3d2f5abe1048318f1c1">"This is all emerald."

</p><p data-p-id="f0a54e74097b281e1c6eb6605d724816">Sina touched the arch several times and scratched it with her fingernails.

</p><p data-p-id="d1a697bac579ab954ac05f403fc7138f">Lan laughed and said. <br>"If you like, I'll buy you emerald accessories."

</p><p data-p-id="180b1873522aa7065045ca2d2fff4b67">"Buy accessories, Unnie. Then I'll watch from the side."

</p><p data-p-id="6ebe60befd87f1f452517f3bce97d999">Sina said so and crossed Lan's arms. Spending time in the sky mansion, Sina realized one thing.

</p><p data-p-id="3ac84a67101e027761f55ee42519cb04">When Shina made Lan buy accessories, Eustaf felt very good. <br>So Sina made Lan buy this and that as an excuse, Eustaf said she would like to call Sina separately and ask for anything she needs and take care of Lan.

</p>

<p data-p-id="9aa428f659bbc1f2ab05f88d04c2ca0c">'A fiancee who asks her to be extravagant.'

</p><p data-p-id="75ab3af5a11fcb0ddc4a15fe3617ac03">"Well, it's Unnie."

</p><p data-p-id="cf293129d428eee698f74440f93bfe84">"What?"

</p><p data-p-id="ed6fbfb853a621219ded4f76a4b9ae96">Lan asked back curiously, and Sina laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="d452af48b4cc27062f75aedbd3612f17">"There's something like that. Wow-"

</p><p data-p-id="02bfe61664ff65eaa82a039f36d96132">The exclamation behind it was an exclamation that came into the mansion. From the entrance, there was a beautifully curved olive tree to match its reputation.

</p><p data-p-id="f7cad0b440559df1c3ee54707853edfb">"It's so beautiful."

</p><p data-p-id="54607380d03fdb5775b4dff0004de31b">"I think so, too." Lan nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="e20678b557852ca97dd95be632dc1e50">The green arch hung a flag indicating that the Duke of Lacia had arrived, and less than 30 minutes later, an invitation arrived from the imperial family.

</p><p data-p-id="12f8245df72ff584e886eeb1b7a1e570">"It's like lightning."

</p><p data-p-id="ace541186e8b9589ea95c58e94303fe9">Eustaf said so and threw a heartless letter.

</p><p data-p-id="1d587b302fc15747d7364482cd96ec9d">"You're not going?"

</p><p data-p-id="cc81a738bf213cde538de69d2ec308a3">Lan asked carefully, and Eustaf replied, "I should go." He said after a moment of silence.

</p><p data-p-id="f3c5aca1fafdb546a50da3e544751c5b">"That day, the day I was late." <br>"Late?"

</p><p data-p-id="60ce5fef08fae33b95bc035be5de3b50">As soon as he approached, Eustaf said.

</p><p data-p-id="956fb358abfb1b0be568319e5a8ca764">"What kind of countess banquet."

</p><p data-p-id="6d972b6124de6fc30a09b41a159ee4b9">"Oh, yes."

</p><p data-p-id="23cf8b13c37494d5d2cffa8fe5d413bb">Countess Lieselotti's banquet. <br>I was threatened with an assassination that night, so it was unforgettable.

</p><p data-p-id="5cf7632b1ea6462d692c5cf9a0d2947a">"I met Prince Label that day. No, he's the Emperor now." Lan opened her eyes wide.

</p><p data-p-id="01b92720774448394a98ecf7b79d832a">"Did you meet Label?"

</p><p data-p-id="44e3d54e14d8ccbc79ae8f3ed99fa695">"Yes, that's why I couldn't wash my appointment."

</p><p data-p-id="7d6d8329133332174e94210c909d0202">Eustaf didn't talk about anything with Olivia. No, it's not that I didn't, but I totally forgot. Olivia's temptation to him was a little insignificant, so he forgot about it.

</p><p data-p-id="f15a7b7f7ab6b1676147eb8c8256eb02">Lan said, 'you met Ravel' .I was lost in thought for a while, and then I got up from the couch. She had already received two invitations in the future.

</p><p data-p-id="3d589ed98fee0c5e7b0715134bb53c62">Looking at the invitation, Ran asked. <br>"What did you talk about?"

</p><p data-p-id="32dccfa77bb98f0cfd44299ad5b4423e">"It's a good idea to get ready." What, I didn't ask Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="c99b8a5d0875200db849e6a835d76a1b">Even without asking what it was, it was too obvious what he was saying.

</p><p data-p-id="bd67c1472cd6b2f53a80606fd281373c">The Emperor's brother usually has one thing to prepare with the noble. <br>Lan shrugged her shoulders and turned to the invitation.

</p><p data-p-id="813873be303554e3d6ba643d96adff36">"The Empress has an invitation."<br><br>He approached Lan, who brought up another story, and Eustaf gently swept her hair. He kissed and whispered on the exposed white neck.

</p><p data-p-id="f2656861f1452b63c834c5d68cd52126">"I won't leave anything to threaten Lan."

</p><p data-p-id="95a9dc02667a0694e5f8c6cc8a6fe3cd">"You're making a terrible confession. My fiancé"

</p><p data-p-id="ad36cb6652acf0aa5efe1057f52701fb">Lan said so and was lost in thought for a moment. She recalled that she and Eustaf were attacked by an assassin at the time and that they almost died.

</p><p data-p-id="3b1d77bbeeffb50a94ffe72d9328a1d7">She turned and pulled Eustaf's hand and kissed him on the back of his hand.

</p><p data-p-id="ef1de0fb6de8bee3fdd2cb4dd9927ded">"I won't leave anything to threaten my fiance."

</p><p data-p-id="6bb2a2f2d56b2855ae4eb6a3ed1b3961">"Lovely words."

</p><p data-p-id="2d943d491e4fbcb2bd94c5a98d87b115">Eustaf muttered as if the kitten had revealed its claws and swept her cheek lightly.

</p><p data-p-id="37826ff8ba378cd2f6593a67e271ec85">'I can't believe you're thinking about light.'

</p><p data-p-id="dc5a16117e40d1c9d00ec42ceb4031fe">Lan laughed and slapped his hand with such thoughts.

</p><p data-p-id="43ee40434080ad592c511304c1a3f380">"Ran."

</p><p data-p-id="d9968dd069a6025fe9e1c912e1f4621c">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="15745a0c76984e3af47d28bfdd6643d5">"Sometimes it's hard for Lan to be so defenseless."

</p>

<p data-p-id="0ec1ce691daad075aff006d8f9bae3a7">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="b2c3c6b799c813c02aa9640e66e75a53">Lan opened her eyes and looked up at him. He looks like he can see without asking, but he had no choice but to ask. <br>Or it'll be awkward.

</p><p data-p-id="33d76a9cf647704dfc87dce3df074228">"What?"

</p><p data-p-id="dc6f275ec7ec5c596d43354b21081d43">"Let's stay rational."

</p><p data-p-id="34d8699122fb945b5ae3be3c70acc42c">That's what Eustaf said, pressing Lan's coral lips with his thumb. When Lan gently opened her lips, Eustaf frowned and released his hand.

</p><p data-p-id="48c6381adcac7f7b3a73f9759472c369">Eustaf sighed as he took his eyes off the pink tongue seen between her open lips.

</p><p data-p-id="dd9d4f1da200f573ecc3a2b24e6b454c">"You are really a genius at wielding people."

</p><p data-p-id="1c36d167df0b2317a67a9a473229bf04">"Ek? What? Why?"

</p><p data-p-id="84a994c53961a90d7d1ec92873c5503d">"Did you seduce me?"

</p><p data-p-id="a6cf8e0bb6e39a89d9565ae6f14f371a">"No, it's not."

</p><p data-p-id="6621535e336fb0266d59c2a23e16ef2d">The reply was answered fast by Lan, so Eustaf sighed again. <br>It's hard to control myself day by day.

</p><p data-p-id="f9d068aeac66769482dec390ea29a537">How far can my fiance go? According to the usual conception? Or do they think they can go as far as Lan is concerned?

</p><p data-p-id="0ce794d59f7429d1fe96b884b9a821f6">'Let's change our minds for now.'

</p><p data-p-id="28648f57bee7f1573974972db4221735">Eustaf thought for a moment and said,

</p><p data-p-id="0f517c531a4c60b2ef2685e42ee3f697">"Ran."

</p><p data-p-id="03476dfc46f04b1709fa32af7358c8af">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="5255dd132e4cc6a86d565dc59822f9d9">"You'll need a dress to go to the meeting." All of a sudden? Lan nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="532ceaba7433a8a2ebac98e3ab5b204a">"Yes, I'll need it."

</p><p data-p-id="4a37c1bf2b811e85bb344b9f90325960">"How much do you need?"

</p><p data-p-id="d755f499e537ccab7abc6cab0cc23073">"Well? Maybe three or four?"

</p><p data-p-id="7a2abce34d1fdf2b39bb34b49c2cb391">"All right"

</p><p data-p-id="99da4e3702dd28cd8998ae53662c252f">Eustaf nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="a0d36fb19f3b27313122fdeba9d1610a">'I'll multiply it by ten.'

</p><p data-p-id="81e602d2a48d6f125340b3ec342d45da">Others say it's hard to make a fuss about dresses and accessories, but why is it so hard for themselves to do them?

</p><p data-p-id="93e9cb7605b849dfd382afdebf35ebf9">Thinking so, Eustaf rang the bell and called the maid of honor.

</p><p data-p-id="445023d16089c01d43718b78f4bdc7c4">******

</p><p data-p-id="9e9545d69561b289297c583e001be97c">Levery came to the green arch with lots of presents.

</p><p data-p-id="54635d0c52402af33b68e45a98872d15">"An extension of the monopoly this year shall be made..."

</p><p data-p-id="9411bd9ab9513f59cf14bf9363c09f67">At her words, Eustaf muttered, "Well," and looked at Levery.

</p><p data-p-id="e99d59fffee3d6086be4c62f505c788a">The size of the Golden Rose Company has grown tremendously. Now, the top three are old words. Anyone would pick the Golden Rose Company as the top of the list on the entire continent.

</p><p data-p-id="e1af66ce81a0691c115b48e6e0b7cd30">But monopoly is not good for anything.

</p><p data-p-id="07a030595d4172a7a6f2462f47bb8d63">Of course, it may be better to collude and monopolize the price of ice crystals, but it was better to reach out to other places than to push them too far.

</p><p data-p-id="6cdb5afb48465317efca2e61f46c2fc7">In the end, after a persistent push and pull, Leverry had to be satisfied with taking 50 percent of its annual mining capacity.

</p><p data-p-id="936460b803aa12f4656db5d68522efc3">After finishing her meeting with Eustaf, she grumbled to Lan.

</p><p data-p-id="26ab9001d44c612cd2527d92f75dbf0d">"50%? Isn't that too much?"

</p><p data-p-id="7830ad82578482375f8fba3d16b15e80">Lan smiled and filled Levery's glass.<br><br>"Did he give you 50 percent? You've been doing it for less than 50 percent."

</p><p data-p-id="67d99107a700f27876b8fc5f15555168">"That's too much."

</p><p data-p-id="72bc5e5a665c619dc057b217debf1a0d">Levery said so, sighing and pretending to be weak.

</p><p data-p-id="c963eb4fe01d19034e15ecf0037cec19">"But we're having a hard time these days."

</p><p data-p-id="d228b935dc4912cb325864b2b72ceb0b">"I don't believe you're having a hard time with the Golden Rose Company. Besides, we have a one-year monopoly on snow sugar, right?"

</p><p data-p-id="6015f00e740ff938d57e2c90350990a5">"That's true, though."

</p><p data-p-id="4822df18896128617c78c4ef7f276d94">Sugar from the white tree quickly spread to the middle class at a low price. In Lazia, there were more young people planting white trees and making sugar, and the white trees fortunately grew well in gravel fields, so they would bring great wealth a few years after the sap came out properly.

</p><p data-p-id="6cf03c12d0e8d9c6055ebc335a2d7d87">'But we can't help farming wheat at all.'

</p><p data-p-id="e7e4a715469a18a8a1a6d7591dd4e3bc">Still, the mere fact that money came out of useless land made the Commoners of territory live. <br>Even if you make it, you can buy it all at the top of Golden Rose at a certain price.

</p><p data-p-id="9389e820a744120d38f15e80ee8952d1">'More than anything, it's better to eat all the sugar.'

</p><p data-p-id="e83d610b4235963a93c31fcd01b6f0ca">It's not going down to too low a price yet, but the price has gone down enough to create a dessert shop for the middle class.

</p><p data-p-id="33b47599132b70b9442b6d8ed27ae761">'It's sad that you can't eat sweets because you're poor.' Recalling Lazia's poverty, Lan put sugar in milk tea.

</p><p data-p-id="765fc4b41fed883bb53b050e8da72f58">"By the way, the Empire must be tough. Two new emperors in less than a few years."

</p><p data-p-id="f6216ed84ea6f1436643a1cecb845970">At the words of Levery, Lan sighed. <br>"That's right."

</p><p data-p-id="910ded06aeb5f071a707602421152cf8">"There's a lot of rumors."

</p><p data-p-id="22d3f240d4950588d6337d9361273c3e">"What kind of rumor?"
