</p><p data-p-id="c94e86d0c2448d90648085a06fea2725">umiere confronted Sina and pointed out her posture one by one.

</p><p data-p-id="e307f9fb6653204afb590a6903de60d7">Sina dropped the wooden sword countless times, but she did not hesitate to pick it up again.

</p><p data-p-id="c32fae60d6a45e13cfbd54af1a5fcd62">"Right foot, fast."

</p><p data-p-id="d35cf725cb9a63f5bad472610ef46bb5">"Think and swing the sword."

</p><p data-p-id="46b5b80b0616049a4d33c65e65c25d0d">"Here, empty."

</p><p data-p-id="70c6b213c3c7124f7e0a3ca7a5031ca2">After dropping the sword to the point where there was an evil sound, Sina picked it up again. It was not until about 30 minutes after the sound of pointing out, the sound of dropping a sword, and Sina raised her hand.

</p><p data-p-id="760a247c97309f709144e6ad59976c1a">"Stop."

</p><p data-p-id="81cbace2b805e9fb68193b7b8393591e">Shina slumped to the spot, breathing heavily. Sina knew for the first time that it was this hard to be in real life.

</p><p data-p-id="3cc483ce50660f504b77d7ddaef2c303">It was hard for even a veteran boxer to fight for 30 minutes on the ring.

</p><p data-p-id="842d5580361212724747995efcea3c86">But after 30 minutes of wielding a sword, it was natural to be exhausted.

</p><p data-p-id="b2b7b5ab3116be881eecacfaf299b3a3">'But is it still a dimension-mover buff? I think I'm stronger than before.'

</p><p data-p-id="f6f7a3af9072aaa3197e49007257a81d">In the past, it was a form of physical strength that could not even be expected.

</p><p data-p-id="11e57a634c57675723afce0dff2c2512">It's been a long time since I took off my cape. Sweat dripped down on her chin and even her hidden shoulders rose.

</p><p data-p-id="8655e0227364459355736959c96c3b4b">Lumiere came back with the cape she had taken off and covered it as if throwing it at Sina.

</p><p data-p-id="70c97194986595bc3dba9a58c8d12c38">"Cool up."

</p><p data-p-id="8c8f14175e15c153cd96d0db2a221efd">"Oh, it's really hot. I think I'm going to die."

</p><p data-p-id="ed1e5504e97d01c74d2175eeab9cfe85">Nevertheless, Sina did not shake off her cape. If you stay like this, you'll catch a cold in no time.

</p><p data-p-id="dc28e748d2868af29d4e634964f4e9fb">"Lumie."

</p><p data-p-id="e55bda14e93fe028cc5ad307ba84aa46">"Why?"

</p><p data-p-id="f026f745509cf6a3c6b3790a93bfe726">"Do you like Lan Unnie?"

</p><p data-p-id="b04381b4db3cfd938b10d0ed01ae6617">It was a question that couldn't be so straightforward, so Lumiere looked at Sina.

</p><p data-p-id="19a9f3a3d038b79ec5c2f796cd33aaff">Her black eyes glanced at him.

</p><p data-p-id="cc432ffc4c9a56faa74e92ebee4e88a3">"I like her."

</p><p data-p-id="33131d940188a5a61942d09dceb339c5">The answer came out smoothly, and Sina laughed bitterly.

</p><p data-p-id="9bf93bfb5339d266a15b768a51321e2d">"Then it must be heartbreaking."

</p><p data-p-id="5c9c23a6798c1d54edf79c0b3a7052da">Lumiere sat face to face in front of her. I heard that immigrants sit like this, but Sina often sat like this.

</p><p data-p-id="7e9a60c1380b169d2b347cc4cef2d577">Lumiere opened his mouth slightly at Sina's words and then laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="5098ae4deca5b834c26547e1027455fb">"Yes, it's a little hard."

</p><p data-p-id="9cd45a8d502fbece87c0066a976ec324">When Sina reached out and patted him on the shoulder, Lumiere laughed again.

</p><p data-p-id="a67cc6e7a0b11a4f6b9cb592466ee422">It was something I didn't dare say to anyone.

</p><p data-p-id="a9a0a701227dd787752a702383447061">His liking of Lan is something he shouldn't talk about.

</p><p data-p-id="62d0de7e376872ee3bcb2ef680e000d1">'But.'

</p><p data-p-id="b4feb2779b8425e368380edc14bbdeea">Sina has no such barrier.

</p><p data-p-id="dd09f610e3509cf029ecb0079584e54b">Lumiere thought it was really similar. Sina and Lan are alike.

</p><p data-p-id="86b96028094b6956adaf019a62ab765a">They look alike, but they are very different.

</p><p data-p-id="24ba322f7da5619ac0003700a6b49ba4">'What a contradiction.'

</p><p data-p-id="5978b94ce2eb567dca670541dba6a1fe">"I'm sure Lumie will have another good person."

</p><p data-p-id="f1649496e311423dff81f27d81c52f3e">Sina said so and recalled Lan. Yeah, that's pretty rare.

</p><p data-p-id="4f81e6627aa0e3eb9803ac46d0f8446e">'But should I say Eustaf has a strong character?'

</p><p data-p-id="82a92dc6efa91e7da2c0517e1945f26f">Standing side by side with Lan, the contrast of black gold is intense.

</p><p data-p-id="dfb35c130480a62502612325ef8e77c7">Of course, it stands out to Lumie.

</p>

<p data-p-id="025f9fe54f3ba0f03c67c725e0b3ee40">Scarlet hair and scarlet eyes.

</p><p data-p-id="c636b89f44f1b2da4abbcee329991788">Without realizing it, Sina looked at his pupils.

</p><p data-p-id="d431606a74824dc163edb376758889ee">The color of the sunset, of course, is not comparable to other places....

</p><p data-p-id="097abc4b4fbcb6017b58010d5447aec7">'A sense that seems to be falling into it....'

</p><p data-p-id="15717261bd62bf22d1be7d54c45f252a">Sina thought so, and then he stared at her in a hurry.

</p><p data-p-id="2768d40378bc4dba1ee6aa1e0df1c660">She jumped out of her seat. <br>"Well, anyway. Come on! I'll get you a drink!"

</p><p data-p-id="51bee0ef6eb81f52c59116826ed09a87">"Drinking?"

</p><p data-p-id="2873dfb7da408a2117d7914f88a2eb80">A funny smile flashed around Lumiere's mouth. Sina nodded her head.

</p><p data-p-id="ecf2e8887318df2785a6de6aeb36b728">"Yes, that's when you're supposed to have a drink. You'll cry and shake it off. It's on me!"

</p><p data-p-id="9330fa423d6dde8cf7f0b02532309157">Shina suddenly murmured, shouting curiously.

</p><p data-p-id="6cb87798bdd445eca6acce9a326345a2">"But is there a bar here?"

</p><p data-p-id="2727f21263ab18895876c5c96c06f351">Lumiere burst into laughter.

</p><p data-p-id="2fde94c6844d2a9946e1dea0b8a8c396">"You'll have to ride a horse to the nearest bar for half an hour."

</p><p data-p-id="958bc3928dcb57d49b32eae7ff960011">Sina grinned as she rose from her seat, shaking her butt.

</p><p data-p-id="0b353485b3bbd3548faf8732a1d543e4">"Then let's rob somewhere else."

</p><p data-p-id="3bfdc785ebb106482fe312b7293250fc">"Somewhere else?"

</p><p data-p-id="7769816798f7444e3a7fbb03eba5cd14">"Wait! Go to your room and wait!"

</p><p data-p-id="95a41e719ee6cebd2541a66d851192ae">Sina said so and quickly ran away, and Lumiere stood in a funny mood and moved slowly.

</p><p data-p-id="b8f58355e27e70c0add6ec5c02ea9990">I felt much better.

</p><p data-p-id="1632c994e5489a214eeef5b09c1bd4f0">When I washed lightly and went back to my room, Sina, who had a big bottle of alcohol, was waiting with her mouth wet.

</p><p data-p-id="078b201ad28405a537c537e626c287dd">"Wash alone."

</p><p data-p-id="1b0a80fd3849010b62a7813a5445f0f6">"Where did you get that bottle?"

</p><p data-p-id="067cde21100ce90ea467d7baf29756ff">Alcohol is a precious commodity. <br>The key to the liquor storage was strictly controlled by the butler, and it was a sign of trust to leave the key to the liquor storage.

</p><p data-p-id="03d08f4769f8cc548fd2ba5a63dcad3d">"I asked for it, so I got it."

</p><p data-p-id="2e8ef7f4885e0936cf21f767e39ad71a">After speaking triumphantly, Sina whispered.

</p><p data-p-id="362973d4ffdb6129b70e039909667278">"Lan's unnie privilege of being a guest is tremendous."

</p><p data-p-id="a129ae4e0262ba838e19f0a2afd282d0">Lumiere smirked and took the bottle from her arms. The size of the heavy bottle was considerable, and it looked at least two liters.

</p><p data-p-id="ee8d26972ae22d9b6aa51641d38ca2a2">'But I'm preparing for the engagement, so it's like a bottle or two of alcohol.'

</p><p data-p-id="2a8fc522c205b4247b7a0adacbce852a">He pulled out the cork thinking so. <br>The smell of strong alcohol came up suddenly. It is a huge number of distilled water that the North boasts.

</p><p data-p-id="3d28f9ad923d25133934f908f0d3aace">"Drink and die!"

</p><p data-p-id="0f0678dcc9778870834d0855ae11fda8">Sina shouted like that and took the glass out of her arms. Lumie burst into laughter because it was a big glass of beer.

</p><p data-p-id="2c77d63a99a66ac478bb29618d79390f">When he filled the glass of beer, Sina opened her eyes wide and swallowed her saliva. The smell of alcohol is no joke.

</p><p data-p-id="1ef08d929f03b4f7673fd2db21414697">"I think it's very strong."

</p><p data-p-id="ea8bf6d6dc9ef67e972e08dddfa6da4b">"I don't know."

</p><p data-p-id="efd499ce52cf2a480cafb04118439879">"Wouldn't you die if you drink it from a glass of beer?"

</p><p data-p-id="51cb8a1bfe4c10568c76e9f8e7f5feab">"Is there anyone who drinks and dies?"

</p><p data-p-id="55a6133c30fcf8e3cb78ea598af2d62a">"There is!"

</p><p data-p-id="fcb9ca37e40082eb0a0043cdb4eed100">Sina insisted.

</p><p data-p-id="89da3a90e1acb85f5d5c0632517ed005">"Drink and die."

</p><p data-p-id="d90b70125bfb0a1afaad07239d283e87">"It's not maintained."

</p><p data-p-id="0ad140f4fdee35e9dfd16faaaf12d333">Sina grumbled and carefully took a sip. As soon as I drank, a hot energy came up from the inside of my throat bruise, and alcohol energy was raging in my stomach.

</p>

<p data-p-id="9fdc8c5a7dfc44ed66355cfc9cdc8816">"Uh-"

</p><p data-p-id="b46f854adfe33feecb7ea066f91066de">Sina shook her body. Lumiere looked at her with a funny face and drank. It's strong but clean.

</p><p data-p-id="bb5e57816bd515d49f4a1703f46ce668">As expected, the North seems to be the best technology for making alcohol.

</p><p data-p-id="cd776c85a31ac6071f4eb1de26bb763e">Not long after drinking, Sina's tongue began to sound twisted.

</p><p data-p-id="f9f984327839095da8bd6c09810b3685">"Lu, Lumi's handsome - he's got another girlfriend!"

</p><p data-p-id="2b6cdc2b9feddc2f013ac8e64ee3d597">It was his first time to compliment like that, so he laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="793a916bf70e2026f7e18969e49c3cbf">"Thanks for that."

</p><p data-p-id="1c2c4ae2946e583050ee9cb2b59b6886">"For real? Awesome, awesome!"

</p><p data-p-id="99a853e0dcf9851d5c72ecf00b827cc8">I don't know what you mean by raising your thumb, but I think it's a compliment anyway. By the way....

</p><p data-p-id="c729d5da03c5c9d7cfcee3291028e6ed">"You're getting drunk too fast for someone who asked to drink first."<br><br>Sina grinned at the words. When I saw the smile, I thought it would be good for Lumiere.

</p><p data-p-id="2c1c7e15e60585ed03c6f004c5370b90">And as time went by again, Lumiere felt he was a little drunk.

</p><p data-p-id="3634d85720aed6636fedc74831bcfced">Because he was talking to Sina about his past. Selling as slaves, living as slaves, going to illegal dumping, killing people.

</p><p data-p-id="27dbb5aeda44e3adfe59969910e857d4">And to Lan-

</p><p data-p-id="9bcbab5ec188eb4dd235ef7c549f6b5d">No, I've never told anyone. Lumiere looked at Sina and reached out her hand.

</p><p data-p-id="a9c7fe4a194b91ce4e6dbf669bf92c4a">"Why are you crying?"

</p><p data-p-id="e56b6d9b62dca5f7610f0388c80a132c">"But, But-"

</p><p data-p-id="3c2c47d4dd589daa85d6d6c0617fa8b6">She didn't even forget her eyes, and Sina was shedding tears.

</p><p data-p-id="aaf43ceab7a0b266eb2b2ab162fed5ea">"That's too much. Lumiere, you've worked so hard. People are so mean."

</p><p data-p-id="e034307f11ab3b340d09ca86cf8ee866">His hands gently scattered around her eyes.

</p><p data-p-id="ad443987c838a8756c7fce09a89091db">"I didn't mean to cry."

</p><p data-p-id="3259417940bef2e7bdbb2f0dd0c00729">"I'm not crying to cry."

</p><p data-p-id="62d71e7f04c6a275d6aa63513b07cf15">Sina picked up a bottle and filled her glass and Lumiere's glass and said.

</p><p data-p-id="39fc8fbe5e499b5549960abcbff779f7">"You'll be happy now. Lumiere, let's just walk on the flowery path!"

</p><p data-p-id="c55a8b0b37b65798a26b1cc530321659">Lumiere smiled and received a glass. Sina wiped her face with tears and runny nose and raised her glass. It didn't occur to me that I might not be able to attend tomorrow's engagement if I drink too much.

</p><p data-p-id="ada52f79de57a5e8180904208156f05c">Lumiere was more important.

</p><p data-p-id="067dd4a8adaf03c29827ce01507e1a80">'It'll work out somehow.'

</p><p data-p-id="4b348b3876bc116786b752742b6f7a96">Sina thought so and drank all the time, and that was her last thought.

</p><p data-p-id="13bbf54a6850c393fb8d1b2b3bba997b">******

</p><p data-p-id="a614a9040d4df974235aa99a82971406">The engagement ceremony was held simply.

</p><p data-p-id="e7e5ad8100d3536ff52a93abc7cf0371">No, in Eustaf's opinion, it was simple.

</p><p data-p-id="bd1f9548edbc2b0a810faf3215ad853f">They invited the disciple to have a banquet, declared that they were engaged, and exchanged engagement rings.

</p><p data-p-id="3794f1990482407985d423aca55bd185">Sitting alongside Lan at the top of the banquet hall, Eustaf winked at his servant.

</p><p data-p-id="35496b18ad0819f9e8a7837233ef0eb5">Then, as the door of the banquet hall opened, a large cart with glass stacked like a pyramid came in. <br>Sina, who was sitting in the guest seat, was still holding her head with a hangover and opened her mouth.

</p><p data-p-id="ca11f890480948e73296539b02e044cc">'No, what I said wasn't that big?!'

</p><p data-p-id="551d66171eba972c7922efdb238170f3">It was a tower taller than a person's height.

</p><p data-p-id="5eb1a29bfa7cbbdc1d3eac311ad22a91">Lan also opened her eyes wide, and everyone gathered at the banquet hall exclaimed.

</p><p data-p-id="3cd4b091d647401728bd8a297af50e6b">When Eustaf signaled, the servant brought a ladder and stood next to it and began to pour champagne. <br>When the first glass was filled and the glasses below it were filled, people noticed what they were trying to do.

</p><p data-p-id="9d9a265f1bcdac79b00eea4e1a2d046f">'But isn't the bottle too small?'

</p><p data-p-id="66e956f44d52cf2fac2f65dc161ee693">Everyone thought so, but champagne continued to flow out.&nbsp; <br>As champagne continued to overflow while filling the third and fourth hem, the people gathered at the banquet hall applauded and cheered.

</p>

<p data-p-id="5853746adb3a5fa7c629a1328b0d7f7e">Lan also opened her mouth. <br>After filling up the last hem and overflowing, the servant picked up a bottle of champagne.

</p><p data-p-id="93add9c570bcbaf1cc6193fb679ef91d">Only then did Lan realize that the servant was Frances. Suffering throughout the week, Frances created a magical work called a wine bottle with champagne flowing out.

</p><p data-p-id="6b55402deef32774cb1e964031d8ded2">When he looked down deeply, people once again gave him a hand-back and cheered, and Lan also clapped hard.

</p><p data-p-id="0cd8a46d2ba9795835569e53c9246c72">Eustaf whispered. <br>"Do you like it?"

</p><p data-p-id="6eb0516d478ca9cde656da5da537aa02">"Huh?"

</p><p data-p-id="5d692656f3af147a9f9de92131aed729">"According to Sina, that's how she celebrates her engagement."

</p><p data-p-id="aefd14dd2efd1e29798f00a8a73b5bef">Lan burst into laughter at the words.

</p><p data-p-id="c577328a3ea2cef8094166d643ac5a3b">No, it's similar - What the hell did Sina say?

</p><p data-p-id="3d9c748c9a9a4eb8aec4b93a7f65a6a8">"Yes, that's right. Thank you."

</p><p data-p-id="7afa90c01f4e3e8b341791774d57e49f">As Lan nodded her head, Eustaf kissed her on the cheek.

</p><p data-p-id="9d80d56af9cb991884069e7bc668c386">"I'm glad if you like it."

</p><p data-p-id="3a17ca5df20e80dc71db2076f004e1dd">He then instructed Eustaf and Lan to put the cup at the top and the cup at the bottom, and then handed out the remaining glasses to the people at the banquet hall.

</p><p data-p-id="dcffdee6cb910228ece5b3d8d281a0d0">Count Illuminati lightly tapped his glass and said, <br>"Congratulations on your engagement."

</p><p data-p-id="51be3279a5cb5a88cdcd5ec393dc15fc">Everyone raised their glasses and shouted, "Congratulations!"

</p><p data-p-id="8f7e29a2fdc84daf2a51607772d7bb5b">Then the banquet began in earnest. <br>The engagement gift was placed at her feet, and everyone came up and congratulated her.

</p><p data-p-id="3b8e210a568c595b4e667078f6082cdc">Sina also approached Ran belatedly to congratulate her, but her expression was so dark that she asked,

</p><p data-p-id="4a3f563455cf6d035d7fff682704140a">"Sina, are you okay?" Sina shook her head.

</p><p data-p-id="83cd882014a899b2691eb22cb21da8c9">"It's all right. I drank something strong yesterday and I think I'm hungover."

</p><p data-p-id="532f2bd075688e4c9c0803048a95f982">Sina still smelled like alcohol, so Lan convinced her, "Oh, my." Shina handed Ran a dreamcatcher made of branches and feathers.

</p><p data-p-id="88c4288d729f472207f3860860032172">"I'm clumsy because I'm not good with my hands, but congratulations, Unnie"

</p><p data-p-id="696759f78f0df0fbfedde503cca4c09d">Lan felt tight in her heart when she thought of Sina who had worked hard to make it.

</p><p data-p-id="e818c329decacb4fefae600832ceaef6">"Thank you very much. Pretty."

</p><p data-p-id="9d9002c272d9cc8762a421ad90b530e1">"It's a charm that prevents nightmares. You can put it on the window and sleep."

</p><p data-p-id="66cacaad540d999ed2ba9d8d3e026d21">"Yes." <br>Lan nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="2c9baaadf9934eef87b9f31bdfad574b">As Lan looked carefully at Sina leaving, Eustaf wrapped around her shoulder and said.

</p><p data-p-id="c61fedfb3b441153c223e42f5fb0a8aa">"Can't you concentrate on me even for a day of engagement?"

</p><p data-p-id="38de952efba0469022702ace60c0dcca">"Don't you have enough? Fiance?"

</p><p data-p-id="d33f34f5b9231c656a826748179a6c17">When Lan said, Eustaf said <br>"All right. Just like now." and kissed her on the forehead.

</p><p data-p-id="8c6d174dbeef9715fcbf20cddb0547b9">"Ran smells good."

</p><p data-p-id="41d815995a23883b84b1b8cdd8ea1e9d">"I guess it's the candy."

</p><p data-p-id="fae2d5f59d6740f3150767fa0701cfc3">"Candy?"

</p><p data-p-id="dec19e0691c228131baa1d6baa4debf4">"Yes."

</p><p data-p-id="68e790b57e1c52e3d337dbb815128038">Lan nodded. When I ate it, I thought it was only a candy with a terrible smell, but I thought it was the scent that came with her now.

</p><p data-p-id="682187adb56131821390034af0c496dd">"Okay, but next time, just tell them not to feed it. 'Cause Lan's original scent is better."

</p><p data-p-id="93ee5b1ce6e38b72d15383efc214327b">Eustaf said, burying his head at the back of her neck, Lan turned red and turned.

</p><p data-p-id="c6188aaa9823c10bef71a3a6bbc92bf7">"Eustaf! Everyone's watching!"

</p><p data-p-id="16acb65af339f6036b7108536dc5826f">"I'll tell they to see. She's my fiancee."

</p><p data-p-id="869314065975718dcec53417ec46a178">"It's different from this."

</p>

<p data-p-id="58d687657e0d720ffc082e6fa4e8f4c0">When Lan pulled out, Eustaf asked, "Then is it okay if no one to see?"

</p><p data-p-id="ddda54414dff200fe93f446fe7fd845a">"There's no way anyone's not watching. We're in the middle of the banquet hall."

</p><p data-p-id="d47437bbcee0531d29ed02f1a161cd92">Eustaf looked up at the word and looked around. All the people who had eye contact turned their bodies around.

</p><p data-p-id="ddb981ae5f0ef9ba8be92180a664c5f0">"No one's watching anymore."

</p><p data-p-id="18c2de230ec7efb95846291e69b4bb3e">"...."

</p><p data-p-id="4edcf79cd7d8eff4e15f58a8ed088019">Lan squinted, looked at Eustaf, and pressed her fingertips on his forehead as she neared him.

</p><p data-p-id="e1d03fe3366f7bcfdadb45e283eaaa69">"Stop threatening with your eyes."

</p><p data-p-id="5661488385e9ba37831e2c530a67668b">I've had it before, and it's really scary?

</p><p data-p-id="48a0e7e4367304d02569d8042843f550">Eustaf sighed, and Lan quickly lifted up her glass of champagne to secure the distance.

</p><p data-p-id="a3b822c13cc7f1db2d6c59ddf635c0c3">After emptying the champagne, Ran turned her gaze into a drink of honey.

</p><p data-p-id="9b6cc6d34e9bfb6b2a74e549d5513c03">Maybe it's because I'm nervous, but I can't drink well. Some of the people who came to say hello filled the bottle, so the pace was a little faster than usual.

</p><p data-p-id="713efa854c2d328273f90bd3f4ec37d5">Eustaf whispered. <br>"Let's dance."

</p><p data-p-id="ea818644e4a8756a81b3207a20371978">"Yes." <br>Lan nodded.

</p><p data-p-id="707c64b49958bd21549f371967219b43">It is also a challenge to keep sitting down. Holding Yustaf's hand, she got up and the two headed to the floor.

</p><p data-p-id="f5f71c23f725f88e28775e9a02a9dbf7">My feet were light.

</p><p data-p-id="ab460617e1cba968e585075e46cb526a">I feel like I'm stepping on the air, not the ground, Lan said with a bright smile.

</p><p data-p-id="690b4ace84731c72a5cfe54f81967fcc">"How?"

</p><p data-p-id="ccd8b0a38c73c5f4c5120810cced3b5c">"...."

</p><p data-p-id="3fbdb753463310b4b4e9511a6217bc9a">Lan wondered and asked back because the answer did not come back.

</p><p data-p-id="a73819a9d1eaba373bc5b081eec76050">"Youth?"

</p><p data-p-id="19a98e099a34ecfc3dfd8f4c1d61036a">"No."

</p><p data-p-id="02c9ec2b81d9f97242c7754a70c0a014">Eustaf turned his eyes and looked at Lan again.

</p><p data-p-id="dc384eafd1471a00e1fd4f0ecd4f09e5">"I didn't hear what you were saying."

</p><p data-p-id="7f166f21ee2ec98779eafbd93a8f5918">Lan put out her mouth and said again.

</p><p data-p-id="2fb833a8b445b6b1ab24861bf00678cc">"How, isn't my dancing skills have improved a lot?"

</p><p data-p-id="32fcf5faf61a86f8017e55163893aff8">"Yes, you've improved a lot."

</p><p data-p-id="9da7c95aec01f2c098aa4d1ff7cffee6">Lan murmured.

</p><p data-p-id="ff54c34cf7805e5789ade038fe9af47c">"I think we've had this conversation before somehow."

</p><p data-p-id="6912a3c04c60434f622b666efab10a7a">"I did."

</p><p data-p-id="e8c41d55cc456b9e5760e226b83b08ee">"Did you? As expected?"

</p><p data-p-id="4ab998b30ccb1c13c6a053be209959e4">"Yes"

</p><p data-p-id="287d8704494b87d4ca060a342d6f040c">Lan laughed again. She went round and round.

</p><p data-p-id="1a785c3c57e7bc480d3d9dd2bc6937a9">"But then I feel like I'm dancing better than I was, what do you think?"

</p><p data-p-id="a294b46c757d21d71fa4c8c9187a3a3b">"I just know you're as drunk as you were."

</p><p data-p-id="50d7043cafaf9b44b0cd0d9e238a165a">"Hey." <br>Lan grumbled.

</p><p data-p-id="4ae22bbd79d8c84fbc8add12a25c9053">The two danced four songs in a row, followed by Quatrium's turn, and Lan barely finished one song before escaping on the floor.

</p><p data-p-id="91b790deff1f9017370c021753cb4b28">After she fell out, I could feel her dancing faster and dancing properly.

</p><p data-p-id="cf366896cc003fd5177cd52c9f6dd180">'It's not quatrium.'

</p><p data-p-id="90ad19a149066bf8fdb1b92f2289cf96">I don't usually practice. <br>At that time, someone held out a glass and looked at it, and it was Lumiere.

</p><p data-p-id="180b88080b90f4c37f226a08ac47b087">"Congratulations."

</p><p data-p-id="b84d9dc1de1621c6e678e97fb0ae3b26">With a smile, he said, so Lan got a glass. She coughed after a sip.

</p><p data-p-id="345fc36d0ae73046519b2a496cd7e2cc">"Cough, cough, what's this?"

</p><p data-p-id="d8aaadc0645cef8b8d929f22e050cb29">"It's alcohol."

</p><p data-p-id="ddad264b16e4dc7d392ec37b6bc5df23">"Very strong."

</p><p data-p-id="49c122460aa5408e8c31ad0bc65ab140">"My heart."

</p><p data-p-id="1c70ad41bc52c5fd36de9ca2a76afbf3">"Lumie!"

</p><p data-p-id="60de6b7f67a7e0823540f62000c2c993">Lan shouted, raised her eyes, and emptied her glass at once. It was Lumiere who was rather surprised.<br><br>"Master!"

</p><p data-p-id="f1f0a99fe7f15d7119d2a7f5c2f91a2b">After emptying the clear and strong distilled spirits into a large cup, Lan blinked her eyes on the rising drunkenness and extended her glass to Lumiere.

</p><p data-p-id="6a88217c0d8069bb6818a73574f6a5a8">"Well received."

</p><p data-p-id="fc8f209b9a11179aa74555254fe473fd">Lumiere's face creased slightly. Lan reached for his face and swung. Lumiere grabbed her.

</p><p data-p-id="f6dd9344c951c2deedc2e8dc9890227e">"Wow, that must be really tough right now. No, Lumiere. You don't look good...." She said, frowning.

</p><p data-p-id="e6344a22501a8219a9f4bb1e1802fc48">"Not just because of my engagement, but...what's going on?"<br><br>Lumiere was silent for a while and then let her go and said,

</p><p data-p-id="3a8fdab7268f0a98375b08cba62bfb10">"It's not a story to tell the master."

</p><p data-p-id="e4139be9997885325a59c9851dfc37cb">He whispered to her. <br>"I just wanted to say that I really congratulate you."

</p><p data-p-id="44da3f5ea699c8cb27b3af0e2f89f851">Lan said, trying to keep her eyes clean by blinking her shaky vision a few times.

</p><p data-p-id="2f00f4f3c044b7aeb2f4373fd68f15ff">"Thank you."

</p><p data-p-id="f0b3b88a52c0aead2c8b98a257cf80e2">Then someone grabbed my waist from behind. I hit something hard on my back.

</p><p data-p-id="3eccd7407e67a10368d0d37307565d6a">"Get away from my fiancee."

</p><p data-p-id="1fc62cb45c3af9bbc5215106888c8d65">Lumiere opened his eyes round and laughed.

</p><p data-p-id="abe89b086fa54002ee990cd7a838f1ac">"I'm sorry I can't say, stay away from my master."

</p><p data-p-id="227f4af8ca1e8a266fe71556b5aa5fb6">I can't believe you're showing such blatant hostility.

</p><p data-p-id="bec6c5085ce619404ab338577cb8efc4">Lumiere somehow became enjoyable.

</p><p data-p-id="3e301f96cecc0d4dc8c5b1b08bacef80">Eustaf was even more irritated by his composure and spit it out.

</p><p data-p-id="8638b6c3c4b8857865e4f7c91be681d5">"Sina just left the banquet hall. Why don't follow her."

</p><p data-p-id="bcbaab8395132aafc7d78dc44119a8d7">At that moment, Lumiere's face hardened.

</p><p data-p-id="a7dd6387caa718c63138f052155bf260">Blue eyes and scarlet eyes faced each other, and Lumiere smiled and bowed his head first.

</p><p data-p-id="083ba0ff8f8daa2f2a18e33b48aa9bc5">"Then I'll back off."

</p><p data-p-id="0aa57e1958aceaebe47d2fd09454262a">Eustaf sighed and whispered to Lan's cut.

</p><p data-p-id="40428aa994422fb9e104134757b154c2">"Don't provoke me, Lan?"

</p><p data-p-id="af58876007f92d788ab9b24f318bf5e0">Suddenly, she was limp and Eustaf was embarrassed and held her tightly.

</p><p data-p-id="c347f5c04968ef443149765d9922d1c5">"Ran, are you all right? Why-"

</p><p data-p-id="c4ba9765d502e5760c236f875fbfd0fe">Zzzz, I heard a sound of healthy breathing. At once, Eustaf felt weak all over her body.

</p><p data-p-id="64009e59a8399b961274400e5e6db5f9">'I can't believe you're asleep.'

</p><p data-p-id="e07cd7852196baeb97369dbdfc526c57">He clenched his teeth and hugged her.

</p><p data-p-id="d67120733fecd0aa8428c1676aecd68d">The surrounding Disciple and knights were looking at this side with a single face.

</p><p data-p-id="c5c97d4db91778d19f205f16895ed257">Everyone knew that the Duke was so into Count Romia. It gave a sense of familiarity to those who felt distant from Eustaf's coldness.

</p><p data-p-id="3d95cf96291f9104a43e006b63246fb9">When Eustaf meant it and kicked his tongue, everyone quickly turned their faces and fixed their facial expressions.

</p><p data-p-id="1be38a639637e9467b9dc277ba4f9f41">However the Duke was scary.
